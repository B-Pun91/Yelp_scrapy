Ming of the Avenue,54 Avenue Road Crayford DA7 4EG,020 8304 7227,Chinese,no_pricerate,no_website,1 review,"MMMMMhhhhhhh Chinese (Cue Homer Simpson drool)  ||| I love my Chinese food and these guys quite simply do the best Chinese I think I've ever had. In a world with a million and one Chinese take away restaurants, finding one that actually makes their food taste nice is amazing.  ||| Their noodles are the thin firm kind, not the stodgy kind that looks more like spaghetti than noodle. Their duck in plum sauce is to die for (if you like Crispy Duck pancakes you'll love these) and their starters are amazing too.  ||| If a restaurants quality can be gauged on how busy they are, these guys are packed almost every day. If you want to go for a meal, yes they are a sit down restaurant first, takeaway second, you'd better book ahead. Weekends are exceptionally busy.  ||| The food is first rate and you also aren't going to have a heart attack wen the bill comes. Although they are slightly more expensive than a cheap takeaway place, we're only talking 50p to £1 a dish more. Well worth it in my mind. ||| Pop in and pick up a menu next time you're walking back from the station and give them a try."
Zingara,295 Broadway Bexleyheath DA6 8DG,020 8303 0219,Bars American (New),no_pricerate,zingara.co.uk,4 reviews,"I've been here both to eat and just to have a drink. Both times I was very happy with the service we received (the staff are very attentive) and the quality of the food / drinks. ||| The downside to this place without a doubt is the price... It's very expensive for everything from drinks to food, this isn't the sort of place you can come of a cheap night out. ||| An important note is that you are required to wear shoes if you come here in the evenings for the bar. ||| When I came the security presence was very high, there were three guys on a Thursday night which felt like overkill. ||| I must say that it's probably one of the better places to drink in Bexleyheath though! ||| A really lovely classy restaurant during the week , ask to be seated in the back in the room with the tree or with a view to the room with the tree; recommend the spinning and hazelnut pasta! ||| Last night after an amazing trip to the Greenwich Union (see my previous review) I met up with my best pal from my childhood to celebrate his birthday with a little bit of food and some drinks . ||| As we went on a Monday night it was absolutely dead inside there was just our table (around 10 people) and two members of staff, Although I had eaten earlier I was still hungry! When I arrived I went straight for the menu, which I have to compliment as it was very comprehensive with about 4 pages of cocktails and quite an extensive range of beers (quite hard to find decent beers in bexleyheath so points there for Zingara) so first off I ordered an Estrella and I asked for the bartender to come to the table as they offered their own type of ice tea but I hat wanted a stirred ordinary Long Island which he was more than happy to do and seemed to really want to engage in conversation about some drinks offering his recommendations ( I have to be honest a he seemed rather over-qualified to work there) I then went on to order an appetiser of fried calamari and a main of paella. I was just leaving my seat to go for a cigarette when the waitress came over to inform me that they were out of Estrella ... I wasn't to bothered I understood as it was a Monday so maybe they were hit hard over the weekend as Estrella probably is the most popular beer they have to offer so I asked for her to surprise me with any other ""decent"" beer they had.  ||| So I'm outside in their smoking area , unlike most bars of this style their smoking area is out front but it's not in a bad location and who doesn't love a little bit of people watching. The whole area is fitted with powerful electric heaters and in the middle of the wall connecting to the inside there is a fire covered by a glass screen which maintains heat brilliantly, although I was bemused by their use of half of a bathtub with a cushion fitted inside as a sort of sofa and a tombstone as a table but it was different, which is always good. ||| When returning from my smoke I was greeted by a 10/10 quality Long Island ice tea, a beer named ""modelo"" and a friendly bartender who seemed rather proud of his work. Shortly after sitting down a waitress brought over our appetisers. I was a little disappointed by my plate of around 5 fried calamari I've never seen a portion so small but I assumed the taste would make up for it... But it didn't. They tasted suspiciously of ""brakes"" or ""3663"" style food so I was very disappointed as far as starters were concerned. From this point I'm gonna jump straight ahead to the mains ... 8 dishes were brought out so myself and my friends sister were left without a plate in front of us which we questioned. The waitress came over to inform us that my friends sister's food was coming but what was much worse was that she had to admit to me that she forgot to even order my food and that if I still wanted the paella it would take 45 minutes so I settled for a Tennessee burger instead. The bartender brought over a small bowl of about 8 complimentary chips to make up for this mistake which to be honest really wasn't a make up gesture at all as most places wouldn't charge for the replacement meal or offer an entire complimentary round of drinks for the whole group but instead I was offered a tiny handful of chips. When the burger arrived it was very mediocre jut a standard wetherspoons style burger, there's not really much to say about the burger other than that as with most ""spoons"" style food it was pretty tasteless and dry.  ||| All in all the venue is brilliant and wonderfully decorated , but I have to be honest and recommend that they stick to being just a bar offering just a small snack menu or something containing just simple bar food such as olives etc. I would definitely go back but only for drinks and the scenery.  ||| Sorry there are no pics but to be honest it was very dark inside and my phone battery was low as I had been out for the entire day. ||| Thought we would pop in for a few cocktails over the bank holiday weekend. The bar staff were friendly and helpful the drinks were good and the music amazing. We had a great time and will defiantly be returning ;)"
KFC,1 Manor Road Erith DA8 2AB,no_phone,Takeaway & Fast Food Chicken Wings Chicken Shop,no_pricerate,kfc.co.uk,1 review,"So yeah - I like KFC (!) and I only really like it from here. This is a drive thru as well as walk in and order, and at certain times it can get very very busy. I normally drive thru because I pick it up on my way home, and there really isn't much of a wait time. And the food? Well, to me it tastes better then other KFCs! Its always hot and because so many people eat here it is always freshly cooked. Also the crumb on the zinger burger and hot wings tastes just like the KFC in Mauritius - which is a good thing!  ||| I have one suggestion though - I think that the chips should be covered because they sometimes get cold! Or maybe I need to drive home quicker!"
Prince Albert,2 Broadway Bexleyheath DA6 7LE,020 8303 6309,French,no_pricerate,princealbertbexleyheath.co.uk,2 reviews,"Ahh the old 'Pots and Pans' as we used to call it. The Prince Albert really is a good pub. Downstairs is a traditional boozer with a good mix of old regulars and people under the age of 50! ||| If you want a trendy bar don't go here. This is for those people who are over 18 and don't want to get smashed on alcopops and cider. They always seem to have friendly serving staff and a nice selection of beers. ||| It can get packed at weekends but usually there is room to stand or even find a seat. Good thumbs up. ||| Upstairs they have an upmarket restaurant. Although the decor is nice and menu is certainly upmarket, their prices aren't cheap. When we went, several years ago admittedly, a meal for four cost £150ish. Now you might expect to pay this in London, but not Bexleyheath. That may have changed now so please check it out, but it put us off going back again. ||| Soo Pub - Yeah. Restaurant - Meh! ||| The Prince Albert is one of Bexleyheath's better pubs. It is a proper pub with really friendly bar staff and decent regulars. Not once in my visits here have I felt unwelcome or like I have to watch my back which is remarkable considering Bexleyheath's reputation. The crowd is a mix of young and old and is a far cry from the lot that inhabit the bars in the more troublesome parts of the town.  ||| There are lots of random brass objects on the wall which gives the pub a sense of history and character. The pub is a bit small and can get a little cramped from time to time but if you ask someone to move over a little so you can reach the toilet they normally oblige without the attitude or dirty looks.  ||| The pub does do food upstairs in the restaurant area which can be a little pricey but looks good for something like a work function or party where people might not mind splashing out a little extra.  ||| Sadly parking can be a bit of a nuisance. You can park in the car park by the cinema which charges or you can park a few roads away around the corner from the old Woolwich/Barclays building which is a couple of minutes walk away."
Joe's Fish Bar,234 Bexley Road Erith DA8 3HB,01322 339286,Fish & Chips,£,no_website,1 review,"Joe's Fish Bar is a good place for quick and easy fish and chips. Upon my visit I found the service to be quick and polite and I found the meal to be of a generous size and very filling. I definitely got value for money. ||| Its location was ideal for me as I was with my brother who was ordering a pizza at Pizza Hut across the road. Not being a pizza fan I opted for a good old traditional chippy and popped over the road to get my meal. My meal was served up and I was back at Pizza Hut before my brother had his pizza ready. ||| Getting to Joe's isn't too much of a problem. The village is a little congested at times and parking wise, if you're quick you can park in the BP garage across the road. If you're not so then the car park in Mill Road has a back entrance which is just a few doors down from Joe's next to the Royal Oak."
Assos Restaurant,140 Crayford Road Dartford DA1 4ES,01322 558884,Greek Mediterranean Turkish,£££,assosrestaurant.com,1 review,"This is a fantastic restaurant offering mediterranean food. Had a three course meal which was served on time, the food was delicious, well cooked and served with a smile. The amount of food was just right, the atmosphere was pleasant and value for money. It has a very nice decor & romantic, would go again."
Hong Kong Palace,180 West Street London DA8 1AN,01322 445058,Takeaway & Fast Food Chinese,no_pricerate,no_website,1 review,"Even after moving away from Erith three years ago, when visiting friends I still insist that we get food from Hong Kong Palace as it's just so good! The portions are plentiful - my favourite is king prawn chop suey which has big, delicious prawns - and the service is usually pretty quick, especially if you go pick it up yourself instead of having it delivered. The barbecue ribs are some of the best I've tasted and are very meaty, although you need to make sure to wash your hands straight afterwards as otherwise you'll end up with orange fingers for a couple of days! This place is good value and a definite recommendation. Apparently they are suffering a bit in the recession, so if you're looking for a good Chinese take-away, definitely give this place a try and keep them in business!"
Riverside Fish & Steakhouse,16 Town Square London DA8 1SE,01322 336460,Fish & Chips Steakhouses Burgers,no_pricerate,no_website,1 review,"A hidden treasure, friendly service and good food!"
Chilli Chill Indian,1 Riverdale Road Erith DA8 1PU,01322 446620,Indian,£,no_website,1 review,"One of the best curry houses I've been to! A delicious range of curry, nanns and rice. You can see the chefs cooking in the kitchen to see how they make the fantastic curries."
Spice Master,45-47 Nuxley Road Belvedere DA17 5JN,01322 445765,Indian Pakistani,££,no_website,3 reviews,"Went on a Saturday for a friends birthday.  This is the best Indian Resturant I have been to in a while.  The resturant is nicely decorated and the staff are friendly and very attentive.  ||| All in all a great night out! ||| Spice Master in Belvedere is a top notch Indian restaurant and a perfect place for a large gathering or party. This place has the lot, great food, an electric atmosphere, good drinks, live entertainment and brilliant service.  ||| The meals are of a very good quality, great tasting with healthy portions too. It is served up in ample time by staff who are very friendly and work hard to ensure that everyone is satisfied. Once you have finished your meal you are more than welcome to stay and enjoy drinks at the table into the late night. There is nobody hassling you to leave as soon as you have finished eating which adds to the comfort factor of Spice Master.  ||| Frequently there is evening entertainment in the form of tribute acts to stars past and present such as ABBA and Elvis although this is mainly towards the back of the restaurant so if you don't fancy listening you can ask to be seated towards the front and the entertainment will provide nothing more than background noise.  ||| I would highly recommend Spice Master for celebratory parties or work functions as a good time is guaranteed to be had by all. Parking is available in street parking spaces outside the restaurant. At weekends or towards busy times of the year it is advisable to book in advance. ||| I don't even want to rate this, it's so poor! The service was terrible. We were in there for over 3 hours. Waited an hour for starters which we're sharing, but. Had to ask numerous times for plates to eat on! Ordered drinks and they took half hour to arrive. The mains took. 2hours and nanas came after we had our curries. We had to keep asking for things cos they didn't come. We took our parents for their first meal out in years and it was very disappointing. We had 5 kids who were really well behaved despite the wait. Pls don't go here, they should not be in business. I will never recommend this for anyone and I have been to many Indian restaurants all over."
Mambocino Cafe,10 Town Square Town Centre Erith DA8 1RE,020 8892 5169,Coffee & Tea Shops Restaurants,£,mambocino.com,1 review,"Mambocino is a new addition to the Erith shopping mall and some might say a surprising one. It was always going to be interesting to see how a coffee bar took off in the town and it's a case of so far, so good. ||| I particularly liked the decor, it was dark and quite relaxing and that combined with the smell of coffee made me very comfortable. I quickly established it as a place that I could come and do writing work as if you sit at the back you are able to cut yourself off from reality for a short while. ||| Unlike other coffee bars, Mambocino offers a full menu which includes all day breakfasts, pasta dishes, meals such as sausage and mash as well as a selection of hot paninis. They are well priced too with a majority of the menu costing under a fiver. The tea and coffee is a little cheaper than the chain stores and for those on the go they offer take away coffee for £1 which considering what other establishments would charge for quality coffee is quite reasonable. ||| The staff are also friendly and professional too, cutting short their conversation with friends to come over and serve me which is an attitude that I like as it made me feel important."
McDonald's,Avenue Road Compton Place Erith DA8 1RN,01322 351566,American (Traditional) Takeaway & Fast Food,£,mcdonalds.co.uk,2 reviews,"A place that you stop by if your hungry or just like there foods. The food is delicious and there McFlurrys are fab. There nuggets are worth a try as I would say there the best on the menu, and just like any other McDonald's restaurant. ||| This is an eat in place and also a drive through and open quite late. There's not much more to say. You drive up, order, pay, drive away, eat. And to be honest - McDonalds is McDonalds!"
Lang Sen Vietnamese Restaurant,305 Broadway London DA6 8DT,020 8304 6998,Vietnamese,no_pricerate,no_website,1 review,"Had a set meal , really enjoyed the beef hot pot an the vietnamese vodka. Good atmosphete an helpful friendly staff. Really worth the effort to wander that far down the broadway."
British Raj,68 Crayford High Street Dartford DA1 4EF,01322 554050,Indian Pakistani,££,no_website,3 reviews,"Went with the wife, found the restaurant to be very nicely presented, the service was first class and very prompt. We had a three course meal, it was very nice, no issues at all with the quality of the food or its portion size, the price was good value. Note i ordered chicken madras which was abit too tomatery!!(too red), tasted very nice, but if you are a madras person ask for less tomato and maybe abit more spice! IMO. very good though, will go again. ||| My sister raves about the food here and drives from Abbey Wood to pick it up. This obviously made me think it must be amazing and that I must try it. So when my boyfriend fancied Indian food we set our sights on The British Raj. ||| They don't deliver so my boyfriend went to order and collect. You can also phone up and collect. He reported that the restaurant was clean and would be quite nice to have a meal in. The guy who served him was really friendly and everything was quickly ordered.  ||| As we hadn't eaten here before, we didn't over order and went with the basics (for us anyway!). ||| We had a meat thali which had a selection of chicken and lamb curry - this comes with a plain bread and rice. We also ordered a garlic bread, onion bhajis and some vegetarian dishes. ||| Everything was fine, the garlic bread wasn't that nice. There was tons of food because of the thali and it was good value for money. It just didn't wow me. I would order from here again but with so many Indian takeaways near me, I may be inclined to try something else. ||| Fantastic food excellent service, very well priced definately our favourite indian."
Chan Oriental Food,91 Barnhurst Road Barnehurst DA7 6HG,01322 333152,Chinese,££,chan-bexleyheath.co.uk,3 reviews,"The service is great and the food is good too with healthy sized portions which are ideal for sharing with family and value for money. The THAI food is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. The Chinese menu is not as good as Oriental Chefs, but pretty damn close. ||| The slogan on Chan's menu is ""restaurant quality at takeaway prices"", and I completely agree.  ||| It's a chinese takeaway with no option to dine in, but the food is a cut above the usual greasy neighbourhood chinese options. The portions are large, and the vegetables have a fresh ""crunch"" to them, rather than the limp frozen vegetables you often find from chinese takeaways. The freshly fried prawn crackers were also a nice change from the soft or cold ones some places give. ||| It's one of the more expensive chinese in the in the area, but I think it's worth paying a little extra for something that's nicer. It's just a shame they don't have a proper restaurant! ||| I have a fondness for Chinese food and Chan is a good place in the Bexley area to stop off and get some take away late at night. If you phone in advance and order your food is normally ready for you  by the time you get there. The service is great and the food is good too with healthy sized portions which are ideal for sharing with friends and value for money. The one time I have had a problem with an item which was missing from my order was dealt with superbly, no questions asked about making sure I got it second time around and a sincere apology from the staff which is all you can ask for really. ||| Parking is available across the street which allows you to pop in and out as quickly as possible and access from Bexleyheath and Erith areas is very easy."
Starburger,6 Cross Street Erith DA8 1RB,01322 331031,Takeaway & Fast Food,£,no_website,1 review,"I have fond memories of Starburger, a cafe in the Wimpy mould which has been in Erith ever since I was a child. Many a school friend's birthday party were held here and so for me personally this restaurant is a little piece of nostalgia. ||| It is wonderful to see that Starburger is still going strong after all these years. Whenever I go in or past it the tables are still full and orders are flying out thick and fast.  You are able to get seated upon entry and the waiter does not hassle you for an order right away. The menu consists mainly of fast food dishes such as burgers and fried chicken which if you like a particular way, they will do for you, something I like as I tend to want to remove certain elements of burger salad from my meal. The milkshakes are definitely worth checking out too, big, thick and cold, just the way they should be. ||| The meals are well priced with most available under £5. If you do not fancy sitting in, a take away option is there for you as is a delivery service for orders over £7. ||| It would not be the kind of place that I would go out of my way to visit but if you happen to find yourself in Erith and wanting food it is certainly worth going into."
Hippie Chippy,4 Station Road Crayford Dartford DA1 3QA,01322 527559,Fish & Chips,££,no_website,2 reviews,"My dad would always take us here on a Friday.  He's church of England but would always respect my mothers catholic heritage by honoring no meat on Friday. The 1st time must have been when I was 6 years old. ||| Will write some more soon... Tired... ||| Decent quality grub. The freshly cooked cod almost tempura-like. A basic chippie, but a good clean shop and friendly staff."
Delicio,157 Broadway Bexleyheath DA6 7EY,020 7998 0932,Mediterranean,no_pricerate,deliciorestaurant.com,1 review,"A good restaurant/cafe for a quick lunch after shopping in Bexleyheath. ||| The prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly, but with prompt service. A man, who I assume is the owner, has taken the time to speak with all the customers each time I've visited, which is a good sign.  ||| Although being advertised as a ""Mediterranean"" restaurant, there's something on the menu for almost everyone, from sandwiches and jacket potatoes to meze platters and kebabs."
Town Kebab,35 Bexley Road Erith DA8 1SH,01322 334886,Takeaway & Fast Food,£,no_website,1 review,"Town Kebab is quite basic and specialises in the basics such as burgers, doner, shish and shawarma kebabs and fried chicken. There's not much that makes the place stand out from other establishments, the prices are average, the food is tasty enough and being in Erith town centre it is easily accessible.  ||| The one down side is that later at night it does attract a lot of people from pubs in the surrounding area who when I was last in there got a bit rowdy and on the way to and from Town Kebab at that time you feel like you have to be careful and watch your back. This is obviously nothing to do with the people who run Town Kebab, it is more of an Erith thing but it is worth being vigilant in order to stay out of harms way."

La Baguette,17 Picardy Street Belvedere DA17 5QQ,020 8311 1113,Takeaway & Fast Food,no_pricerate,no_website,1 review,"It is rumoured that L.A Baguette in Belvedere was close to closing down recently because it was not making enough money. How?? This place is great. Sandwiches are made freshly to order exactly how you like them with a very wide selection of fillings in front of you so you can see exactly what is in your bap, roll or sandwich and how much you want in it. They also sell a selection of cakes and sweet treats as well as cold drinks so you can buy your complete lunch here, ||| The sandwiches are very filling, much better value than the likes of Subway and is located right next to Belvedere train station so it is easy to grab something for lunch on your way to work. They have also started a service which delivers sandwiches to local workplaces which is ideal for conferences or group lunches. If you are driving then free parking is available directly in front of the store. Waiting times are never too long either, no more than a couple of minutes even at busy times."
Nando's,2 Crayford Road Crayford Road Dartford DA1 4LD,01322 554023,Takeaway & Fast Food Chicken Shop,££,nandos.co.uk,7 reviews,"One of the best Nandos around and deservedly busy. The atmosphere is relaxed, the service first class, staff are polite & helpful. Parking is plentiful. The food is fantastic. seating is comfortable, its GREAT with the FAMILY or even a meal for two!.Its also near the tower retail park so after your wife has spent your money you can always get her to buy you a nice meal...then again!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. ||| For years I have heard of Nando's and decided to give it a try even though I do not love chicken much. The first time I have to admit that I was quite disappointed. The food was not bad, but almost 9£ for a Chicken Breast Fillet Wrap with two small pieces of chicken was too much.  I ended up there a second time and decided to order something else. Chicken Breast Fillet Burger was better value than the wrap and good, but nothing special. Service was friendly and fast in both cases, but Nando's is not my cup of tea. ||| Really friendly place! The food is epic too! Remember to bring your Nando's vouchers! ||| I have only been to Nando's once and although I was not disappointed with the food, which was very nice. I was appalled by the service and the price. |||  Myself, my partner and our baby girl each had a burger and soft drinks and the bill came to in excess of £30! Furthermore, there are no waiters as such as you have to queue up to order at a till. |||  Although the food was tasty, it was overpriced and the experience wasn't enough like a restaurant to make me want to take my family there again. ||| I love nandos. I went to the one in Crayford only a weeks ago. We were a party of 14 and although they do not normally reserve a table, i was able to ring them an hour before we were due to go down there and they pleasantly agreed to get a table big enough for us all ready. |||  On this occassion the food was RAPID - i can honestly say that no sooner had i ordered, sat down, my food was in front of me. |||  I was, however, a little dissappointed that they only had fresh orange with bits and not any other form of juice (i.e. orange squash). But other than that a lovely experience. I will definietly be going back. ||| This Nando's is Crayford is very new , only a few month's old.Nando's is big there not normally this big.You can get a take away form Nando's which is handy for the people on there lunch break.Nando's sell chicken dishes which are lovely.Nando's are a good price and there food is very good , of a high quality.If you buy coke , you can get free refills on it which is good for the children.There is wide range of chicken dishes to choice from like burgers , half a chicken.You chose how hot you want your meal to be , i have medium heat.Which is not to spicy. ||| Great place, just like every Nando's is. Always recommended."
Big Daddy's Fish & Chips,94 Barnehurst Road Bexleyheath DA7 6HG,01322 359000,Fish & Chips,£,no_website,1 review,"This in my humble opinion is the BEST fish & chip shop i have ever eaten from.

Spice House Restaurant,19 Crayford High Street London DA1 4HH,01322 557735,Restaurants,no_pricerate,hungryhouse.co.uk/chilli-crayf…,1 review,"I love Spice House .. Ok , it went through a patchy area , with bad chefs and average food , But now its back in safe hands , and the quality it once used to be has returned. I can honestly recommend so much from the expansive menu , that i could possibly be writing this review for the next 2 hours ! . The garlic chilli chicken is to die for , as is the Chicken tikka Rezalla , the lamb and chicken tikka starters are seriiously good and the garlic chicken rice is a must. The service is amazing , the staff very friendly , and they really cannot do enough for the customer. Highly recommended !!!!!."
Yildiran Kebab & Burger Bar,98 West Street Erith DA8 1AQ,01322 448761,Takeaway & Fast Food,no_pricerate,no_website,2 reviews,"Yildiran has to be one of the best kebab places in the Bexley area and that is evident by the number of people who go out of their way to get food from this establishment. Although there is no real nightlife directly around the area, it is still busy at all hours of the day. Luckily this does not affect serving time as the staff are quick and efficient at processing orders and delivering food (usual waiting time between 5-10mins). They are also really friendly and after a couple of visits they recognise your face and engage in conversation which I feel is a nice touch.  ||| Menu wise there is the usual selections of burgers, kebabs including doner, shish and shawarma which regular customers swear by. You have a choice of salads and sauces including the burger sauce which goes well on most food they serve. Personally the thing that makes this kebab house stand out from all others is the chips. They are always crispy and cooked to perfection. The eclairs also come highly recommended as a finishing touch to what is usually a marvellous meal.  ||| The one downside to this place is the size. It is very small and compact and when busy it is a little short for space. There one table with four seats but it is not really for staying in and eating your meal, it is more for customers to sit whilst they wait for their food. It is important to point out that this is primarily a take away joint. But considering the quick service time, this is not too much of a problem.  ||| Parking outside can be difficult on a busy night. Mildred Road provides the most convenient parking but more often than not people just neglectfully park their cars directly outside the shop thus clogging up the entire road when literally yards away there are plenty of parking spaces.  ||| Yildiran also provides a phone-in-advance service which means that you can collect your food on arrival without having to wait which is highly convenient for large orders or if you are in a rush.  ||| Prices are about the same as you would pay in other kebab shops for food but considering the quality (and the generous portions) Yildiran Kebabs provides great value for money. ||| Rubbish, absolutely appalling!! First of all, there was a chuck piece of plastic in my kebab and secondly the kebab I ordered was raw with blood!!!  ||| I've been a loyal customer for the past 10 years and the food used to be decent and the service wasn't half as bad, but it has honestly gone down the hill and it leaves me no choice but to go elsewhere for my kebab.  ||| I found it particularly humiliating when I was asked to put tips in the box provided by the staff. Don't get me wrong, I usually tip great services generously, ""willingly"", but not only does this particularly experience makes me want to get a refund let alone tipping them lol. What a joke! Thats it, I'm boycotting this place for good!"
Frankie & Benny's UK,28-70 Broadway Bexleyheath DA6 7LL,020 8303 5962,American (Traditional) Italian,££,frankieandbennys.com,5 reviews,"This is a decent restaurant in a traditional american 60's diner style. The food is what you'd expect really, nothing too fancy but they do some good burgers, the food is decent quality and reasonably priced. The staff are all friendly here, they also do some rather tasty cocktails. They have a nice bar and a cocktail barman who does all the flair so it's quite impressive. |||  They host a lot of birthday parties and it's a good place for a large group of people to go, they have tables which can be set together quite easily, often get parties of up to 20 here. |||  I'd recommend having a cocktail or too, it's conviniently located next to the cinema too for a film after, or the wetherspoons is just across the road for a drink! ||| I've been to this Frankie and Benny's a couple of times - with family and also with a large group of co-workers for a Christmas party. I wold definitely say I enjoyed it more when I was there for a normal dinner. |||  F&B's tries to pass itself off as New york-style Italian food, but as an expat New Yorker that this is just not true. This is typical anglicised Italian food that is decent enough for a dinner out, but not anything fantastic. |||  As for the Christmas party, I would definitely NOT recommend going here with a large group, at least not during the Christmas season. Although promised a larger roped off area, we were all packed into one long table with no room whatsoever to mingle. The food was not very good - not up to their normal standard - and service was very slow. I understand that it was packed and hectic, but hopefully since I've been they have learned to adjust themselves to such a situation. ||| Went with the family (2 kids), the decor & atmosphere was very nice indeed, the service was fantastic, the food was very good, the portion sizes was also very good, HOWEVER, if you are a steak person, as i am, this was not as good as in some places i have eaten, the steak seemed cheap bearing in mind the price £10., The rest of the families food was enjoyed very much. The 5 stars is for service, atmosphere and all food, EXCEPT the steak.. ||| Frankie and Benny's is a great place to go when you fancy some American food with the diner experience. |||  The menu consists of pizza, calzone, steak, chicken dishes and burgers; and the drinks menu has a number of cocktails, beers and soft drinks. |||  Although I usually enjoy eating at Frankie and Benny's I often find that I feel rushed. It isn't the sort of place where you can sit and enjoy a relaxing meal, and so I wouldn't recommend going there for a romantic meal, it is more a place to go with friends and family. ||| I used to love this place it was always great food but the last year or so I have been really disappointed the last few times I have been. The service was really slow and you know what its like when you have kids - they want to be fed now!! Also the last time I went in there it was for lunch and they hadn't had thier delivery so they didnt have burger, chick or fries!!! how can you open without fries!!! I might give it another go to see if I have just been unlucky."

Always buzzing with crowd. Families, couples, friends and who else not! Everyone's enjoying their favourite meals and choices from the Carvery and other choices from the Kitchen.  ||| They serve food in sumptuous quantities. For the carvery, you have choices of three plate sizes, in different prices and you will be served by their Carvery Staff of the day.  ||| Their regular menu has a variety of stuff to try from platters, starters, soups, pastas, burgers, salads and fries, even sweet potato fries (hmm.. i love them) ||| Extremely helpful and wonderful staff.  ||| They have seating inside and outside (great for summer days). If you have kids, they have a nice play area outside, slides and things like that, which I'm sure the kids will love. They even hold parties. Beautiful pub to have your Sunday roast or to grab a pint anytime of the day.  ||| I go there at least once every week, mostly on weekends to have a quick brunch and I have never been disappointed.  ||| Food is also very good, I've uploaded a few pictures so you can take a look."

I thought the decor of the restaurant was nice but  found the service to be slow (staff were talking to one another and ignored us) the restaurant at the time wasn't busy!  ||| Ordered salmon dish and it was cold and undercooked!

I normally get the the Railway Chicken and it's exceptional. Highly recommend.  ||| Overall, I will continue to use Masala Inn as my number 1 curry house! ||| Just had a fabulous experience at Masala Inn. ALL of the staff was so warm and inviting.  They were also very accommodating as we had a diner under 3 years old with us. They engaged with us and the little one which was nice! ||| The food was DELICIOUS. They brought out a crispy thing with 4 difference sauces which were delicious. I had the Tikki Masala with King Prawn it was really good. And my dining partner also enjoyed their Garlic Nag with Chicken. The Garlic Naan was also very good. ||| The restaurant was very clean, to include the restrooms. After dinner they serve a hot towel and mint. And a balloon for the child! The child loves it and great advertising as you walk down the mall! ||| If we were local, we would return - really good and very friendly staff."

Barnehurst Kebab,96 Barnehurst Road Barnehurst DA7 6HG,01322 333176,Burgers,£,no_website,4 reviews,"This kebab shop is easily the best in the region. I go here as often as I can without compromising my waist size. All the meat is prepared fresh daily and with their own secret recipe I'm told. The lamb doner is home made by the gents who work there rather than a factory made cash and carry version.  Staff are friendly and enjoy a good chat while they wait for your meat to cook on the grill.  ||| Prices are standard for the area and portions are generous. You can usually tell how good the food is by the amount of people queuing inside! Don't forget to give them a call to place your order before you go there - you might be waiting a while.  ||| Tip: if you're going for the lamb shish - go medium cooked. It's amazing! ||| An excellent takeaway kebab shop, and one of the best in the area. This isn't authentic turkish food, but a classic takeaway lamb donner or chicken shish kebab served in a polystyrene box and wrapped in white paper.  ||| The portions are massive, and always freshly prepared. At most kebab shops, I'd order a large kebab and chips, but at this place, even a small kebab alone is enough. If you do feel like chips, they're fried fresh to order and served in paper like a proper fish and chip shop.  ||| There is some limited seating, but I couldn't imagine actually eating there, as you'd probably end up sharing the table with people waiting for their takeaway orders to cook. It's a shame they don't do delivery, but you can call ahead to order and then just go in to quickly to collect. ||| Barnehurst Kebab is quite average with not much making it stand out from other take aways in the area. Prices are very reasonable and it doesn't take long from entry to getting your food and leaving. There is a table to wait and there are normally papers to browse through which gives you something to do. ||| The shop is a popular stop off for people making their way home from Bexleyheath and I have seen the place get quite rowdy or full of drunken chav characters after pub kicking out time which can be quite unnerving.  ||| Parking is available right outside the shop which allows for a quick visit. ||| This is IMO, the BEST kebab takeaway (also sit in if you wish) in barnehurst area. The portions are HUGH, the doner kebab is fresh daily, the meat is not greasy or salty as with other kebab shops, it taste good on day & even better the next day!. The mixed kebab shish etc is very taste and grilled to perfection. The chips tastes as good as a chip shops!!, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

It offers good quality fish and chips as well as pies and sausages at a reasonable price. The portions are quite large making it real value for money and a good option if you fancy take away food. I have always finished my meal feeling full which is more than can be said for most big name fast food chains.  ||| It can get busy on Friday and Saturday nights and you might have to queue for a few minutes to be served but it's not really much of an inconvenience.

The restaurant is a low lighted long room that is empty most nights but somehow I think more people might ruin the mood with the family. You are accompanied by great yet subtle Indian music to keep the mood alive. The service is great, their attitudes are amazing. So polite and like to check up on you.

The cod was foil wrapped so was still lovely and hot when I got home, but on opening the sealed package the aroma that hit me was literally mouth watering. The cod was cooked beautifully (melt in the mouth kind of beautiful) and was accompanied by tomatoes, onions and a little chilli sauce. What a healthy and unexpected tasty delight for a wheat intolerant person, to be able to venture in to a chip shop and have a truly wonderful (and healthy!) meal! ||| The owner is charming, his staff efficient and now I know that he fries his chips in separate oil to the fish (the batter contains wheat) AND changes the oil every day, I'll be popping in for another treat very soon - hot chips with salt and vinegar! Heaven! I may also order a chicken shish (minus the pitta) to go with it.... ||| Highly recommended! A* ||| Ruined me for any other FOREVER. Chips - hot and phenomenal. Fish - thin crispy batter. HUGE fillets of freshly caught cod. The BEST curry sauce OMG! Ruined me, and I enjoyed it beyond belief. I wish if takes a picture... :( ||| Hmmm... My craving for naughtiness peaked as I ambled through zone five today. This emotional and all to frequent urge had to be fulfilled but luckily I spotted Broadway Traditional Fish & Chips. ||| GREASE! It had to be mine. On entering this little takeaway eatery I noted that they also sold kebabs and fried chicken. I couldn't help but smile when the man behind the counter pointedly made me aware that they sold 'Fried Chicken.' 'Dude! Come on!' ||| I ordered dirty sausage in batter with chips. Sarah S order a halloumi and salad pitta with chilli sauce. Although my order was really good, her halloumi sandwich kicked my greasy treats ass. I had seriously bad food envy. She let me share. ||| All in all I was surprised by the quality and price of the food. When I am back in Bexleyheath I will be getting myself a halloumi & salad pitta for sure."

It is a little shop, but its up the quieter end of the high street and it is a nice place to go have lunch and have a rest from school/work/shopping. The food is always lovely when I go there, and it is very well priced for what you get. Its a great service, its clean and the staff are friendly. Its Pie & Mash is SUPERB.. REALLY GOOD, but it also does fried food (Breakfast) as well, this is first class, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. ||| Luckily my friend knew where to take me during my solo trip to London as I was severely unprepared for this. I kept hearing about this traditional pie place located on a lower level of the Covent Garden Market and apparently you gotta have a pie when visiting. ||| I decided to go with the chicken and mushroom pie since I couldn't man up enough to try the steak and kidney pie. Only organ meat I will consider is foie gras otherwise please keep all the kidney, brain, heart and any other Jeffrey Dahmer bag items away from me please. Overall, the pie was pretty good! flaky shell pastry and chunks of chicken inside. What else can you ask for in a savory pie. ||| Also got a beer... because every meal in London has to have a beer on the side. ||| A great english cafe with a fantastic range of breafasts and lunches. ||| The cafe is family friendly and given how busy this place is from very early morning through to late afternoon the staff are both friendly and helpful ||| We went here and although hubby enjoyed his pie etc I thought it was a bit rank. I have had better although it was very cheap. I would give it another go to see if a fair better next time. ||| This is a traditional english cafe, they have tea, coffee and all the usual kind of soft drinks as well as traditional british food such as pie, mash, chips, sausages, fry ups and liquor (a creamy parsley gravy-no alcohol).

The quality is excellent, chips how they should be, golden, crispy and fluffy on the inside.  ||| They also can't beaten on price. Many of the lunchtime meal deals are under £2, much better value for money than the regular fast food chains around town. Service is quick and you even have the option of staying in and eating at a table. On sunny days it is nice to sit on one of the benches outside near the fountain and peoplewatch. ||| If you're peckish in Bexleyheath then try Tom Bell's.

My Daughter wasn't particularly hungry, but they wouldn't allow her to order a child's meal. The manager was rude and unhelpful. ||| I hope this review is not removed. ||| I have enjoyed many meals in this restaurant since I was a child in the 1970's, .However I was to say the least very disappointed when I took my daughter and grandsons in and we were refused a childs meal for my daughter who wasn't hungry enough for a full  meal. Both my grandsons were having a meal and we were all having drinks. I cannot understand the reason for this.  I also found the manager rude and unhelpful and I will not be returning. I will also be advising my friends and family not to go there. ||| Very nice chip shop, chips are thick cut and fluffy in the inside, portion sizes are small for the price, they are placed into trays, which most of the time fall out, the fish, savaloy etc is tasty. Service is quick, seating is available inside, but its always busy as its very popular. Highly Recommended for takeout and sitting outside watching the world go by...."

The food is very nice, the atmosphere is okay, but could do with some background music. ||| Last time we visited we had rustic pizzas which were very tasty. The ice cream was also good, but then it should be for over £4 per scoop!! ||| The price of the drinks was also very inflated.  ||| The premises is intimate and good for Romantic Night out, Pizza is on par with Pizza Express in my opinion.

It's such a shame this restaurant has gone down hill was a nice place to eat in. ||| It's kitsch. It's got Mexican hats and a free tequila shot with the set menu! But that's about it.

(Wahaca even laces there hot chocolate with one) but tequila rose? That milky strawberry milkshake one that is just a gimmick and it's horrid. Like I have bad memories of this because at 18, tequila rose sounds well exotic. It's not and I'm not proud of my 18 year old self for drinking it everytime we went club sushi!  ||| Also sure the set menu sounds super value, I left 75 percent of the meal. Hence the star. It was salty- maybe it was a preserved one? I don't know. I just didn't enjoy my meal.  ||| The cocktails were watered down and they don't do hard shakes. Even though I asked.

La Siesta Tapas Bar,176 Broadway Bexleyheath DA6 7BT,020 8303 9426,Spanish Tapas Bars,no_pricerate,no_website,1 review,"My sister and i went here for lunch, i guess we should have known how bad it was going to be when we were the only people in there! ||| To start we had garlic mushrooms and spanish tortilla. Well, i have never quite tasted anything like it before, i love my garlic, but those mushrooms were SO strong i had to have a rest and a drink inbetween each slice, im not sure if the over powering taste was even garlic, it just tasted weird. The spanish tortilla, well, it was a triangle of srambled egg, with 1 new potato stuck in the middle of it. ||| My sister doesn't eat meat, so we then opted for the vegetable paella, Hoping it would be the resturants saviour... unfortunately not! The rice was completely overcooked, and there was a pool of juice at the bottom of the pan. the only flavour you could taste was black pepper. ||| At this point we decided to call over the waiter or manager (not sure who he was) We tried to explain politely our problems, but he didn't apologise, or offer us anything else, He just argued with us. Telling us he has never had complaints before, and tried to then explain to us how to make a paella, which didn't go down to well with my sister and i as we are both very keen cooks. ||| Basically it ended up in a huge row, there was NO sign of any customer service, and as we walked out the waitress even started shouting abuse at us!!! ||| Would i recommend La Siesta??? oh yes, i'd recommend everyone stays as far away as possible from it!!!!"

I looked at the menu and was flabbergasted regarding the vast array of authentic Italian pizzas. My waitress who went by the name of Trixie Mattellę. Oh I do have to say that the girl was quite the uckers. However her milkshakes did certainly NOT, bring all the boys to the yard including me as I found them flavorless and overly sweet, as sweet as when I licked the sticky tables smothered with their original recipe barbecue sauce from KFC. ||| 3 stars"

Pizza Express,163 Broadway Bexleyheath Kent DA6 7ES,020 8303 3040,Pizza Italian,££,pizzaexpress.com/visit-a-resta…,3 reviews,"I love Pizza Express, the pizza (ETNA!!!) is really nice, the service is always spot on. However, this place is smallish & there are alot of teens!! atmosphere can get loudish!. IMO.. Pizza Express is always nice in a romantic setting, the pizza's, pasta's etc are that good, but in this restaurant it will not be romantic, due to size of restaurant & loud teens! ||| Visited with a friend. There really isn't much in Bexleyheath to eat, and I wanted to use my taste card so Pizza Express won. ||| I used to eat here all the time and have fond memories of pizza and a cold glass of wine. The menu has changed since I last ate here (about 3 years ago) and there wasn't really any pizzas that appealed to me. When I ordered I was offered a thick or thin base, which I found quite strange. So I went with the thin. It was huge and they now give you a little pizza cutter which I thinks make it more like Pizza Hut than Pizza Express. The pizza was on the bland side, but could easily feed two. ||| Our server was friendly, and although he went through the motions with us (water, olives etc) he never managed to bring anything no matter how many times we asked. I asked for a glass of water 4 times then asked someone else who brought it straight away. Not the best. ||| Overall, I have no intention of eating in this branch again (unless I'm in Bexleyheath...), but I would be willing to try different locations.  ||| Was an ok price with a Taste Card but I wouldn't pay full prices. ||| I was very impressed by this  beore the new staff and refurbishments. The restaurant was full of suspect Italian ,Kosovan and Polish staff.  I have nothimng against them but when I went to eat there recently after the recent refurbishments their attitude towards me had changed from very friendly to very rude and often trying to extract tips from me.  Before the tips were included in the bill. ||| I find this sort of behaviour unacceptable in this country though it is more common in the Continent where rules and regulations aren't so stringent and the pay not so good.  In this country foreign staff are paid well compared to their countries so should not try to cheat anyone. ||| I prefer the decor before of modern vibrant paintings of food and the wonderful dispaly of garlic, peppers and onions giving it great sense of good food and good cooking with wonderful aromas as the kitchen is open plan.  I feel the bare light bulbs very harsh and primitive and the concentric rings of bulbs on the back wall rather strange.  Light bulbs have never been a feature of pattern or interior design anywhere. ||| If things continue as this I don't see a Pizza Express survivng in Bexleyheath.  I am quite a good cook and i can make a very competent Italian Pizza and so I don't need to eat here  if I don't want to. ||| It is a shame to see such good restaurant going down hill. ||| I've always liked Pizza Express food. It's of the very high stsndard and I was impressed that it had French roots which would explain the excellence in food,  but it has changed hands several times , sometimes Italian ,sometimes Enlgish with Sri Lankan chefs and Bangladeshis. ||| The dough balls are exceptional and only in this restaurant do they serve them and their bruchettas  both the tamato and red oniion and the fungi are excellent to say the least.  My favourite pizza is the Pizza Venezia from that famous watery city Venice.  Their tiramisu is also of a high stndard though a bit pricy and their Italian ice cream is very good.  I also recommend their floater coffee which I am a great fan of as I don't drink alchohol. ||| The decor before was contemporay with vibrant modern art and  now it is tastefully done in contemporarty fresh colurs with local interest of William Morris and famous pilots after the Wright brothers from Bexley.  There is also nice caligraphies of female singers. ||| I have always found the staff very friendly and the Italians are excellent.  I've recently been to IIaly for a holiday  and I found them as friendly as them and the food as ever of very high standard. ||| I would recommend anyone to this very reputable restaurant chain. ||| They had once brought out a recipe book of Pizza Express meals which I now regret not having bought but that would mean I would not go out as often to eat there."
Ocean's Takeaway,166 Mayplace Road East Bexleyheath DA7 6EJ,01322 558929,Takeaway & Fast Food Fish & Chips,£,no_website,1 review,"I was initially impressed by Oceans Takeaway, I've found their customer service has gradually been getting worse with each visit.  ||| The food isn't bad, but I think the owners would much rather run a daytime business. They rarely answer the phone, and when they do they say they're not accepting new orders for the evening, even though they're still open for another 20 minutes.  ||| One evening when they wouldn't answer the phone, I drove to the shop to let them know their phone wasn't working. The owner said he was too busy to answer the phone, although the shop was near empty.  ||| Another time, I walked into the shop, and the owner said he'd deliver the food to my house rather than me waiting for a pick up. I think he was trying to get rid of me!  ||| Their opening days are also random. Apparently they're closed on Sundays, but I've driven past and seen the lights on and door open.  ||| This really isn't the way to run a business... ||| Ocean's Takeaway is the reincarnation of the ""Happy Fryer"" fish and chip takeaway in Barnehurst. A menu came through my door earlier in the week, so I gave them a try and was pleasantly surprised.  ||| They do fish and chips, which was much better than Big Daddys fish and chips near the station. The cod was a generous size, and of good quality in a nice crispy batter and the medium chips were a huge serve and the proper chunky fish shop style. It was nice to find the chips weren't cooked in the same oil as the fish either, as I don't like the taste of fish tainting my chips.   ||| They also have a tandoor oven, and were baking their own naan bread and making tandoori chicken! I think they're missing a good opportunity by not advertising that they have these offerings, as there are a lot of Indian takeaways that don't bake their own naans, yet this place seems like a standard fish and chips takeaway from outside.  ||| I tried the spicy chicken wings too, and found them to be nice and crunchy, which a hint of heat.  ||| They also do kebabs, which weren't bad, but I think the quality of Barnehurst Kebabs round the corner can't be beaten.  ||| I'd definitely recommended Ocean's Takeaway for anything fish and chips related, or the chicken in naan bread."

The service is always warm and welcoming and the food is always tasty and filling. I usually opt for the Tikka Masala which is rich and has plenty of meat in it. The portions are generous and the naan breads are some of the biggest I've seen in the area which is great as I love naan bread, often preferring it to rice. Finishing a meal can be a bit of a struggle and you have some to put in the fridge for later. ||| Price wise it is value for money and what's better is that they do home delivery so if I'm feeling lazy (which is often) I don't even have to leave the house. If you do opt to pick the food up then you can park around the corner. ||| I have ordered once, I found the food expensive for what it was, the food was also delivered luke warm!, the madras was not any madras i have tasted before, the other members of the family did not enjoy their food either, a pity as it was recommended as being one of the better Indian Takeaways!"
The Village Sandwich Bar,59 Nuxley Road Belvedere DA17 5JN,01322 440066,Sandwiches,£,no_website,1 review,The Village Sandwich Bar is well worth checking out if you find yourself in the Belvedere area. I am not keen on pre-made sandwiches in shops as you never know what goes in them. With The Village Sandwich Bar you get to dictate what goes in the sandwich.  ||| There are plenty of main fillings on offer from basic ham/chicken to chicken tikka and aromatic duck. Salad and sauces are also on offer and you can have the sandwich just the way you like it. There is a bakery element to this shop too with a selection of freshly baked cakes and doughnuts to go with your lunch. The usual crisps and cold drinks are on sale too.  ||| Prices at The Village Sandwich Bar are also reasonable with the average filled bap/baguette costing around the £2.50 mark however this is value for money as my tikka roll was generously filled and was the perfect cure for my hunger. Various meal deals involving snacks and drinks are also available. The gentleman who served me was very polite and friendly and obviously valued my custom. I shall definitely be returning there soon.

It's all been kitted out with lovely tables and chairs and the menu looks great. Hurray we thought, another upmarket eatery for dear old Bexleyheath. ||| The first clue that not all was ideal is their menu. £20 a head??!! Now that's not exactly OTT but for Bexleyheath you'd be looking for something a little lower, especially before you start adding drinks and extra's. The second clue was in the level of service. ||| It was clear fairly early on that although their prices said upmarket, the only thing 'market' about it was where the owners usually did their trading. Service was generally pretty poor and the quality of the food did not meet what you'd expect from the price. ||| Having dug into things a little more after wards and asked around a few contacts we have, the impression I get is that the owners are more into this for the quick buck than for a love of fine dining. ||| Not somewhere I would recommend. That said, if they can invest in the basics a little more it could be a lovely place to go. ""Could try harder"" as they used to tell you at school. ||| Went to the Bank for a Christmas Works Do.  The starter and soup were okay.  The meal of turkey and gammon was appalling, the meat was so overcooked you couldn't even cut it, the food was stone cold and the veg was raw.   ||| The owners had cut the mini Xmas puds in half so you got an inch thick slice which they microwaved along with the chocolate brownie, but when you overheat this type of dessert as it cools it goes rock hard - by the third or fourth spoonful the cooling process was complete and you couldn't cut it with a spoon.   ||| And at £25.00 a Head including the 10% service charge it wasn't a cheap meal.  The still expected a tip, but the service wasn'r great either, sat down at 8.30 but didn't get our first course until 9.15.  The Toby Carvery up the road is 50 times better for half the price. ||| I wasn't impressed with this place at all. We went here for a works meal, 10 of us. Table booked for 9pm, It was gone 10pm when we were told one of the starters was unavailable. 10.30 before we even began to eat. Only one person said he enjoyed his meal and that was the steak. We paid £10 deposit for each person and when we got our bill it wasn't deducted. I will not be going here again."

Their fresh cream cakes are to die for, as well as the remaining of the cakes they have to offer. ||| Also, warm cups of tea and coffee can be found here. ||| The Bakery is a prime example of why traditional family bakeries are better than chain bakeries and a reason you should continue getting your fresh bread from here. ||| Best bakery around by far and u can see how popular they are by the ques from outside thats why i started going here we had susage rolls pastys and cakes and also bought some bread all tasted amazeing and the prices were very reasonable try this place im sure u will love it ||| Wow... Well... What can I say... I've been here loads of time for cakes, biscuits and pastries, but that was always straight off of the shelf. For my girlfriend's birthday I decided I'd get her not one but two custom made cakes. ||| Pam really likes Fresh Cream Gateaus so, I asked them to make her a small one along with a custom shaped flower cake (she loves their flower cookies so it's basically a massive cake version). ||| She's allergic to nuts and had given up chocolate for lent (I told them both of these things) and was assured that neither of these two ingredients would be anywhere near the two cakes. ||| Two weeks go by and I go back to pick up my cakes. First of all I'm shown an amazing fondant covered flower cake with bees and accents and loads of amazing detail - they hit the nail on the head. ||| Next I'm shown the fruit covered fresh cream gateau... It looks beautiful... BUT, it's covered in nuts. It's the day before her birthday and I now have a cake I've paid for and can't use. After some discussion with the staff in the store (there were no gateau makers in) I took it away with me, I planned on showing it to her mum and seeing what she said. ||| I managed to get both the cakes home and was promptly told by my mother-in-law that it wasn't allowed in the house, so on the phone I go. After a brief chat I was told I could take it back for a full refund - not great but better than nothing. ||| I made the journey back to the bakery and spoke to who I can only assume to be the manager who made a comment along the lines of ""well, there's nothing in the book to say no chocolate or nuts so you shouldn't have ordered it."" If I was told any of that at the point of ordering then I obviously wouldn't have placed an order for something that HAD to have nuts or chocolate for my girlfriend that is allergic to nuts and had given up chocolate. ||| Either way I managed to get a refund for the gateau but for the return service and attitude of the manager alone I can't in any good faith give them more than one star. I'll probably still buy from them but it will only ever be from the cabinet. ||| Despite the fact that they made a really good custom fondant cake, they managed to HUGELY mess up 50% of my order. I don't have any faith in their ability to take an order and follow it through to completion. As we cut into the fondant cake there was a genuine concern that they'd made it chocolate. It's not a nice feeling to cut into a cake and feel tense. I would never want anyone to be in that situation again. I'm lucky I didn't just order the gateau as I would have really been left in the lurch the day before her birthday. ||| I've shopped here loads of times and this whole experience is just really disappointing. I can't recommend them. ||| The Bakery in Pickford Lane is a great place to pick up a filling lunch at a reasonable price. The usual baked goods are available as well as filled baguettes with a range of fillings to choose from and hot and cold drinks all to take away. Unlike most bakeries there is an option to sit and eat in. It's quite a charming and intimate place to have lunch, ideal for conversation and a catch up.  ||| Their meal deal makes The Bakery affordable, around £4.20 for a baguette, cake and a hot drink which is tastier, cheaper and more filling than most other High Street delis. It's close to Bexleyheath station and so is great for grabbing food on the way to and from work. There is are a few parking spaces in the street next to the shop."

Soprano's Pizza,304 Erith Road Bexleyheath DA7 6HJ,01322 336683,Pizza Takeaway & Fast Food,£,no_website,3 reviews,"If you fancy Chicken & Ribs its first class, chicken is tasty the ribs are sticky & VERY nice. not so keen on the pizza though, its nice but no pizza express standard. They deliver. Recommended. ||| I don't like to give small businesses bad reviews, except where I feel it's truly deserved, and unfortunately the Sapranos kebab/chicken/pizza shop is one of those businesses you're best avoiding. ||| The shop displayed a hygiene rating of ""3"" in the window, although I found that hard to believe from the untidy shop and unusual smell. There were no other customers on the evening I went, but they seem to be receiving a lot of online orders, so I suspect most of their customers have never seen the place and they rely on delivery orders.  ||| The chicken shish kebab I had was terrible, make with the dregs of leftover, limp salad. I would have ordered some chips, but I noticed they had been sitting there for a while, and they only bothered to turn on the heat lamp immiedately prior to an order!  ||| If you're getting a delivery, try somewhere else and if you're coming to the shop, go to  Barnehurst Kebab next door instead. ||| i dont normally write reviews but for the safety of people do not order from this place, the kebab smelt of feet. yes feet, its been 30mins and i cant take the smell away, i am absolutely f********* shocked that these people think its ok to sell this. the chips were soggy. i hope a food inspector visits this place because these people are selling awful stuff. £30 i spent and put all of it in the bin, i would pay £100 to lose this smell of feet. just eat if you read this please remove these people from your website, i would consider paying you more than they are just to remove them as i dont wish for another human to have this smell. it smelt like year 9 p.e on a piece of donner lamb. also, on the justeat reviews there is about 100 5 star reviews from 'dime' who is probably the 'shef' who served me feet. seriously i feel sick from the smell and am horrified, please please if anyone with some sort of position reads this get someone to inspect this place!! they are selling rubbish"

Pizza Hut UK,279 Bexley Road Erith DA8 3EX,01322 351930,Pizza,no_pricerate,pizzahut.com,1 review,"I have ordered a pizza from this hut on 15th Dec 2018. The shop is open until 11:45pm and order was placed at 11:30 pm. They accepted the order. Order was delivered after 1 hour instead of 30 mins. The delivery boy did not follow the delivery instructions. Requested him to not knock the door as it's very late and everyone at home is sleeping, so instead on arriving ring on the phone. He didn't follow instructions and banged my door really bad at 12:30am. Got my pizza and while serving realises the pizza was under baked. The base was sloppy, veggies on top looked like they were just put on it and pizza was cold. Felt like the pizza wasn't even baked properly.  ||| Couldn't call back the hut as it was closed by the time. I had then thrown the pizza and didn't have it. ||| Decided to contact customer service on following day.. everything went well we agreed for a refund and the agent said it will reach me within 5 working days. ||| Checked bank account after 10 working days .. no refund nothing at all. Contacted them back .. lady on the phone said it takes 16 working days not 10. I said ok that's fine. ||| After 16 working days contacted again as no refund in account .. they said my bank details verification had failed so they need to confirm again.. did that everything was correctly provided at first time still they didn't know what went wrong. Again they said 16 working days from today you will get refund. ||| Called back last week as still had no refund.. the customer service agent hung up the call on me when he didn't have answers to give me. ||| Called back today and was told it will take 10 working days from today.  ||| I have almost given up the hope that I will ever receive this refund back. The pizza costed £22.40 and I must say I have spent more than £10 worth money in calling these guys over last 1 month now.  ||| I have never had this kind of customer service and such a ridic process of treating customers ever in my life. First of all the hut shouldn't accept orders at the time of closing if they think they cannot deliver the required standards of food.. but if they do accept than they should be able to provide the standards.. which wasn't the case here. This place does not even deserve 1 star but I have to do it to write this review."
