Indian Ocean Ni,350 Antrim Road Newtownabbey BT36 5EQ,028 9083 9888,Indian,££,indianoceangroup.co.uk,3 reviews,"Indian food is generally top of the pops for me, so when I review an Indian restaurant, I would like you to believe that I know what I'm on about. I've tried them all!  ||| The Indian Ocean near me is part of a chain of three restaurants - Glengormley, Carrickfergus, the Odyssey. I love them. Did you ever order a garlic naan and not be able to taste the wondrous bulb? Not here, you can see the chopped cloves in the stuffing. What do their chefs marinade their lamb in?  I wouldn't know how to get such a simple ingredient tasting so awesome.  Big, generous handfuls of fresh coriander on the tomato dishes. Flavour you would't believe. Options beyond the usual curryhouse staples... Stuff I'd never heard of, the welcome choice of monkfish etc.  ||| The Glengormley restaurant is especially atmospheric inside... Lovely decor, smooth service. it's pretty damned relaxing even if you're only waiting for a takeaway. If curry is your thing, if you are also addicted to the joys of spice, then give this place a bash. I can't recommend it highly enough. ||| I'd be delighted to give this place five stars, but for the fact that they don't do deliveries.  Maybe in my case this is a good thing - I'd probably not bother cooking ever again, but still.  It'd be nice to have their madras and naan at my beck and call. ||| Popped in for a bite of lunch. First time since it's been done up. Although I was early the bald gent at reception didn't seem friendly- he ushered me to take a seat. I was eventually seated and given my menu by my waitress who again didn't smile and was quite regimented. I ordered a set lunch of mixed starter and chicken tikka chilli masala with nan. The food was exceptional-the ch tikka in the starter was fried which it shouldn't have been. The thing that let it down was the service. The food server again served the food and did not smile and appeared robotic. I have eaten in all the Indian Oceans and this has been less than great service I have become used to. On leaving I thanked the waitress and the bald chap-who was on his phone and he didn't even look at me when he replied-not professional!! ||| I have frequented both branches of this well-known Indian Restaurant on many occasions, and have never really been disappointed. Their branch in Newtownabbey was the most recent port of call for my Dad's brithday, as we decided to treat him to an Indian feast, which we ordered in and went to collect. I had the Chicken Rogan Josh with Mushroom Pilau Rice and Peshwari Naan Bread. Absolutely delicious. Lovely thick tomato based sauce with a great spicy kick at the end. The chicken was tender and there was plenty of it, although my Mum, who ordered the Chicken Bhuna was disappointed to find quite a measley portion of chicken in hers. ||| Despite this one complaint, the food was piping hot and ready when we went to collect it, which is the one down-side of thier take-away service, they don't deliver! It is a bit of a pain having to drive up and collect it, but the food really is great and it was worth it to celebrate my Dad's birthday. The restaurant itself is clean, spacious, nicely decorated and the tables aren't too close together ( a real bug bear for me, usually) and the waiters are attentive and helpful. A definite yes for eating in or taking away."
Pizzarella,Unit 5 Ferbro Buildings 335 Antrim Road Glengormley BT36 5DZ,028 9034 2420,Pizza Takeaway & Fast Food,££,pizzarella.just-eat.co.uk,6 reviews,"There's a lot of mention of Domino's here, and it's actually thanks to Domino's that I came to this place. ||| I had tried a number of times to get through to Domino's. Friday was upon us once again, and it was time to have a traditional Domino's meal deal, but unfortunately I just could not get through. ||| They aren't always the best at answering the phone in that branch, so I thought nothing of it and jumped into the car and drove there (I'd have had to have collected it anyway, since I live outside of their delviery area) But when I got there, the queue was ridiculous, and I was very hungry. ||| I had my heart set on pizza by this stage, so looked up Vicinity on my phone, to see if there was anywhere else nearby, and it threw up this wee place (I'd never heard of it before) ||| I got there in a couple of minutes, and was pleased to see there was not much of a queue, so wasted no time in ordering my pizza with the usual toppings, cheese, tomato, peppers and onions. ||| All in all, it came to just over a tenner, which is less than I would have paid, and it tasted great..Not quite a patch on Domino's, I must admit, but I would certainly go back! ||| The service was fast delivery. Maybe this is a skewed opinion from a non-local but we were very confused about this pizza. We ordered pepperoni and sausage- neither topping appeared to be what we typically associate with those toppings- oh well. It wasn't terrible but the meats were just strange. Also ordered cheese garlic bread- that was delicious!! ||| I ordered a large vegetarian, large ham and mushroom and small pepperoni pizza with two portions of chips last night and went down to collect. It was ready within 15 minutes and when I brought it home it was delicious. The kids loved the pepperoni pizza and we loved ours. The bases were nice and firm and crispy,toppings excellent and chips not oily. All in all great locally owned and run store. ||| I've only recently discovered this place, I'm pretty sure most people will head to the larger fast food chains that surround this area (Dominoes / Papas Kitchen) but it's well worth a look in (or a bite in as the case may be!) In my opinion this smaller, local business is so much better. You always get a bit of craic from the staff which I think is important, not a depressed spotty teen or automaton serving you!  ||| I didn't even used to be a huge pizza fan, but after trying the 'Pizzarella Special' ... drool... I don't think I could go back (Cheese, tomato, onions, peppers, mushrooms, salami, and ham & olives or corn & pineapple ...I go for the latter) it's like one big giant feast of a pizza, great for when you're near starving! They usually put on week day specials where you can grab a bargain for a family deal. Their sundry items are spot on too (think perfectly cooked garlic bread, hard on outside, soft on inside, with melted 'supreme cheese' running off it ... mmm) *Goes to dial number* Too much temptation! ||| I usually get shouted down in my house when it comes to pizza. Inevitably, we end up ordering from Dominos, but given the choice, it would be Pizzarella everytime for me! ||| The pizzas are really fresh, they'll put basically whatever you want on them, and they're pretty cheap (they do charge for delivery, but last time I ordered it was a whole 50p, so nothing too scandalous!). About the only negative I can come up with is that sometimes, the dough can be a little overdone and once, we were sent a totally burnt garlic baguette, properly char grilled and inedible, actually. ||| Other than that though, Pizzarealla is definitely worth trying, even just for a change from Dominos or Pizza Hut. ||| We head to this place every few months, when we take a notion for it. The food is always good, kind of satisfying 'normal' food that really comforts you when you're in the mood for it. Thier sweet chilli potatoes are really nice, I can never have enough of them actually - mind you - what's new? The pizza's are great, although I never can finish one because we always order the one that is too big and I always regret it. Thier pepperoni is gorgeous and they aren't stingy on the cheese like some places can be, in my opinion. The food arrives quickly and they don't keep you waiting - and they have a good selection of cold drinks available too."
Lin's Garden,4 Longlands Road Newtownabbey BT36 7LZ,028 9086 6636,Chinese Takeaway & Fast Food,no_pricerate,no_website,1 review,Excellent food and service would highly recommend open 6days a week and fast delivery
Harmony,1 Ballyclare Rd Newtownabbey BT36 5EU,028 9084 9800,Chinese,£££,no_website,3 reviews,"Harmony is a Chinese & Japanese. |||  I went to Harmony with my friends for the Sunday 3 course meal deal which is £6.95 each, the choices was great. |||  The restaurant is clean and relaxing and the staff are attentive and pleasant. Thouroughly loved the food, the honey chilli chicken was fantastic. A great way to spend your Sunday afternoon. |||  I would definately recomment this restaurant to everyone. ||| Harmony Chinese (funny, this place is beside Harmin Park so is this on purpose? Harmin - Harmony Chinese? Or it that just me?)  ||| Anyway, the restaurant is in competition with the many fast food take aways on offer around this area, I'm glad this place has survived, it is a great Chinese. I used to get noodles from here all the time, and I'm fussy about my noodles, I love them, I can't help it and in Harmony they are really tasty. Plus, they do a great vegetarian range which always impresses me.  ||| The restaurant isn't the fanciest of surroundings, it's certainly in an strange location and the staff can be a little on the odd side sometimes but hey, it's good food so you can't complain that much. Personally  I'd go for the take away option then you don't have as much hassle or oddness to deal with. Sorry, but it's what I've experienced. Maybe that's just me though. Try the black bean sauce here too, it's another particular favourite of mine. ||| We called in here for the first time a couple of weeks ago to actually sit in, rather than just order the usual takeaway to the house - and were pleasantly surprised. The food is a Chinese and Thai option, and the menu is extensive with lots of choice depending on what you fancy - although I really do like thier chicken satay or the honey chilli chicken (although that's what I always get!) The staff are really nice (as I find most staff in Chinese restaurants, actually Asian restaurants are) and the food arrived in a timely manner and was really very good and enjoyable. I would recommend this Chinese to anyone in the area, either for takeaway or for dining in."
Cafe Cuisine,21 Carnmoney Road Newtownabbey BT36 6HL,028 9083 9173,Delis Cafes,£,no_website,2 reviews,"So, after having reviewed and waxed lyrical about La Cuisine on the Antrim Road, I discovered it had closed down without my knowledge. Panic ensued as I worried if my local branch of this deli had met the same fate, but I'm pleased to report that it hasn't as yet - phew! ||| La Cuisine have been in Glengormley since I was really young, and I always loved their food. It used to be a real treat to go there for lunch, and in truth, it still is! ||| The food is all cooked on-site that day, so it's beautifully fresh and properly tasty. Highlights are definitely the pies and the vol-au-vents (very 80s, but who cares when they're so yummy??) ||| The cafe is really tiny, so there are only a few tables. This can cause a bit of traffic at lunchtime as people wait for tables, but don't think this means you'll be rushed through your meal. The staff are always patient (I know this because I've gone on several occasions with my 18 month old nephew - patience is definitely required!) and willing to accommodate whatever request you may make of them. ||| La Cuisine is a lovely place to go for lunch.. and I would visit quite often - although word of warning - it may be easier to carry out than to sit in, as the cafe itself is very small.  ||| I'll start with the bad points, to get them out of the way.  Firstly, the cafe is a little hidden and may be hard to find for someone who is not used to the area. The car parking around it isn't adequate and you can never get a parking space. The cafe itself is also very small.. you may be waiting for a table for a very long time, so it is better to take away. Even if you do sit in, you will notice you are sitting very close to people who are taking away, so it doesn't feel very private.  ||| Anyway, good points. Food is absolutely fantastic. I'm a huge fan of the large hot cajun baguettes.. they are like heaven in your mouth. Their food always looks nice and fresh in the counter and they offer a wide range of lunch time dishes that caters for everybody. It's always very good value for money compared to some cafes and sandwich bars that will charge a fortune for a baguette - especially for how much you get. They are very generous with their portions, which is a factor that I love to see in a food place. Also, staff are very friendly, always smiling no matter how busy the cafe is.  ||| Overall, with the number of bad points you'd expect a 3 star rating, but this climbs up to a 4 star, simply because their food is amazing and you can't get much better."
Sleepy Hollow Restaurant,15 Kiln Road Newtownabbey BT36 4SU,028 9083 8672,British,£££,sleepyhollowrestaurant.com/#_=…,8 reviews,"Nipped in here for lunch on the recommendation of a friend and it didn't disappoint!  ||| I admit staring at the menu with a bit of immediate terror at all the fancy schmancy things staring back at me, but - I had the fish and Parmesan fries, hubby had the steak sandwich and chunky chips.  For dessert we had the pear crumble, burnt cream of the day (coffee) and the sticky toffee pudding mini desserts.  ||| Great place to have lunch, it was quiet, service was friendly - though there was a looooong wait between courses and we ended up in a bit of a time crunch to get the child from school - but it was absolutely delicious, a great wee find tucked away.  I imagine Christmas time here would be lovely ||| Absolutely delicious! Went for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised! The food was amazing and cozy atmosphere! Service was also good! The lamb was lovely ||| I treated myself to a spot of lunch at The Sleepy Hollow. Chef and proprietor Paul took over in early 2013 and has taken this place to great heights.  ||| On arrival I was seated and presented with a bottle of ice cold water before choosing cod and chips for my main course. The lunch menu is on a single sheet and has a very varied choice from all local producers. Great value of two courses for £14.50 or three for £16.50-I only managed a main for less than a tenner!! ||| The restaurant itself is a 55 seater, split into three rooms on two levels, with an ample car park. The bare stone walls and exposed wooden beams give it great character. There is also a lovely farm shop (which I believe is to close,such a pity). ||| When my food arrived it came on a rectangular wooden board (not a fan of wooden boards). There was a Wee shot of beer, a mini bucket of fresh tartare sauce (could really taste the capers!!) a deliciously fried piece of cod resting on mushy peas and wedge of lemon resting on the peas also, lastly a mini pan of four crispy,very fat, thrice fried organic Marris Piper chips!!! The portion size was amazing and I didn't need starters or dessert or tea/coffee. There is an extensive wine list and the Christmas Menu is ready. This is definitely a restaurant to find and visit as you will really enjoy!!!! ||| Been here a few times and never dissapoints! Had food from their Sunday lunch menu today, everything was delicious.  ||| For starter I had the scampi with salt & pepper tiger prawns, light but full of flavour. For main, I had the roast turkey & ham, served with crackling, cranberry and chestnut crumble, smoked bacon stuffing with cranberry & orange - AMAZING!  ||| The portions are presented very skillfully, like something you'd often see on Masterchef, but yet are fully satisfying. We were full after the mains, but still managed a cheeky dessert.. ||| Instead of 1 dessert, you get to choose a couple of mini desserts which is a great idea. I opted for the white chocolate and lemon meringue and the mini sticky toffee pudding, both great and just perfect size to finish off a great meal.  ||| The only thing I could fault is the service as it tends to be quite slow anytime I've visited, but I would still say the food is well worth the wait!! ||| Absolute disgrace. I contacted the restaurant on 16th February to arrange a booking for 4 adults and a child on Mother's day. I got a response back asking to confirm time, which I did. ||| Now, on the 4th of March (2 days before Mother's day) I called to ask for something additional and they had no record of the booking! It was lucky I called or it would have been a massive disappointment on Mother's day! ||| Their excuse was that the online contact form was for 'inquiries only' - if this is the case why did 'Lyndsay' who I dealt with not come back and say so instead of leading me to believe a booking had been made? Absolute joke! ||| Safe to say I'll not bother with this place again in future! ||| It's not very often I would give a 5 star review, but this place deserves it! ||| A quaint country cottage set on the outskirts of newtownabbey, this place oozes charm and sophistication. I have been here a few times for both lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed.   ||| The interior is very charming and the dim lighting makes it very cosy and intimate. The staff are very pleasant, well mannered and extremely helpful.   ||| There are not many dishes to choose from but each dish will have  either chicken, pork, beef, vegetarian etc, so something will satisfy. I always think a shorter menu means that more effort can be put into each dish! The menu is exquisite and full of good,local  and fresh produce.  ||| A carafe of water was placed on our table, so we didnt feel the need to order any drinks.   |||  The main courses are quite substantial and we could not finish it all, but we did leave room for dessert. You can  have a choice of two or three mini deserts. We opted for two each which was plenty. I would have struggled to eat three. ||| For the quality of service and food this place is not expensive. They have a lunchtime offer of 2 courses for £14.95 or 3 courses for £16.95.  ||| A selection of alcoholic drinks is also availible and the drinks menu is written on a wine bottle. It's these little touches that make all the difference. ||| If you have not tried here I urge you to do so! This is a very special little place and I guarantee you  will return. ||| Food, decor and surroundings all 5star!!  ||| It is a converted farm house with a vintage yet modern decor inside!  ||| It's quite intimate in regards to table settings but with the service a food provided I wouldn't care if I was sat at the same table as strangers!  ||| My all time fav thing about sleepy hollow is their deserts! Mini and multiple!!  ||| The apple and blackberry crumble with homemade vanilla ice cream is to die for! ||| You will need to book a table in advanced for here which makes me sad as I am always a last min sort of person! ||| At first when my sister invited me to a restaurant up a country lane and in the middle of fields I thought she might be crazy, however this cozy hideaway is the perfect way to dine with friends or family.  The cozy barn setting had a homely feel and the food was far from an average.  ||| The setting are plush, comfortable and relaxing, the staff are friendly (however could have been a bit more attentive - it was busy so I'll let that one go).  ||| When the starters and mains came we were so impressed, the portions are very generous and the total came to £16 each - we had lunch but needed no dinner later as all the plates were cleared.  See the pictures for the type of food, it is a bistro style cuisine and high quality cuts of meat. ||| There is a farm shop, however it is closed until Easter (2015) as they are switching suppliers; previously they made their own produce but high demand has meant they have to source externally for the shop.  ||| I would recommend this place for a special occasion, catch up with the girls or even just for a weekend place that is unique and homely.  ||| A definite must visit, just call ahead to book the table to avoid disappointment!"
The Loft,36A Mallusk Road Newtownabbey BT36 4PP,028 9084 0008,British Pubs,££,gototheloft.com,3 reviews,"My two daughters, wife and I had the pleasure of dining in the biggest restaurant in Glengormley, that is The Loft.  ||| Perched above a row of shops in the busy Industrial area of Mallusk is this fully equipped 120 seater restaurant. When we ascended the stairway and entered the reception area we were amazed at the size!! The kitchen hatch was immediately to our left and at the helm was local chef John Hadden (who has worked in Ballyclare Golf Club, Knags, Sugar Rays and Blue Chicago). John has just introduced a new and very appetising menu......more on that later!! ||| Further along was the fully stocked bar, with a myriad of wines, beers, spirits and soft drinks and I hear they do cocktails!! ||| To the right as we entered was the seated reception area (above), where live bands and entertainers will play on busy weekend nights. ||| We were taken through the dining area and seated in our well accommodating booth, overlooking the car park. The booth was set for four and would have fitted six!! ||| Chef John's passion for good quality wholesome fresh food showed through in the menu. ||| John was saying that there will be an express corporate lunch starting soon at £5.95 to cater for the many corporate clients and office workers in the area, who want good quality food, quickly and at a reasonable price. ||| There were so many dishes that screamed out, ""Eat me!!!""  ||| So we decided to take the plunge and order. My two girls had the pork sausages (2 pcs) with skinny fries and freshly breaded chicken strips (3).  ||| My wife opted for the salmon sizzler and chunky chips,whilst I had the chicken stack. ||| We all loved the presentation of the food John served up. The baskets for the kids meals went down a treat with them, the sizzler really sizzled and my stack was well stacked!! The breaded mushrooms were really crispy and served on a simple dressed salad with garlic mayo. The chicken strips and sausages were piping hot, the salmon and prawns were delicious and not over cooked and the chunky chips worked well with the fish. My stack was the best!!! The champ was perfectly cooked with tasty crunchy scallions, chicken was butterflied and succulent, the pepper sauce was reduced well and spot on and the tobacco onions were juicy and moist and not oily!! The portion sizes were big and we all polished the food off, leaving just enough room for dessert. ||| Kids having mint chocolate ice cream and strawberry ice cream respectively whilst my wife and I shared the banoffee. We were well and truly filled after all this and all for less than £40......because kids eat free on a Monday and Tuesday night!!! ||| There is BYO on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday (can only avail of one offer per order) and Steak Night on a Thursday. ||| This restaurant is a truly fantastic family friendly place which offers great quality food at very competitive prices. There is also scope for corporate/business lunches with the advantage of having a section able area to the rear which can be used for presentations, product launches, training, conferences, private parties, communions/christening and the whole venue can be used for large parties and even weddings. As can be seen this is a truly remarkable restaurant and we are so lucky to have it on our doorstep. Do call in and try for yourself......watch out for promotions and the new flyer, it will have a discount on it!!!! ||| I used to work in one of the industrial areas in Mallusk, and on the odd Friday, our boss would take us all out and get us our lunch. Due to being in Mallusk, there isn't a great variety of places to go, so the Loft (or the Jolly Beggar, as it was called) was the place we always went. ||| Additonally, if you actually live in Mallusk, this is pretty much the only place to go in the immediate vicinity. ||| It's in a rather large building, so there is plenty of room and you are pretty much always guaranteed to get a table. ||| The service was always good, and the menu had something for everyone, burgers, chips, sandwiches, wraps, paninis etc - in my time I've probably tried them all, although the chicken wraps were a particular favourite. ||| The pricing is reasonable too, not that we paid as we were always treated to it! ||| Although I often travel through Mallusk nowadays, I never stop off, and the Loft isn't great enough to warrant a special trip just for that, but if you are in the area, give it a try. ||| I agreed to meet an old friend for a spot of lunch outside town one rainy afternoon, so off I trek to what is now known as 'The Loft' (It was previously The jolly Beggar - a much better name in my opinion!) Anyhow, we met up and ascended the bright purple carpeted stairs to the, very unoriginally named, Loft) It wasn't the busiest of places to say the least, though it was 2pm on a rainy Wednesday so I guess it can be forgiven, there were six diners including us, two old men, a couple and us girlies. The menu had a selection of the usual pub grub; burger, lasagne, Panini, wraps, soup etc. which were all priced at a very reasonable £5 each. We were served by an ordinary waitress in an ordinary bar and had ordinary meals. Nothing to write home about. The portions were a little on the measly side, our chicken wrap had about three pieces of chicken in it! The garlic chips weren't even garlicy and the salad was a rather uninspiring undressed straight out of the bag type job. Saying that, as fart as meals go, I've had worst. I'd always been intrigued by this bar, so in that aspect at least my curiosity is satisfied, even if my appetite wasn't. It's not somewhere I would come rushing back to but I'm sure it does its job for the local workmen about the place. I saw adverts for the DJ at the weekends, now I don't know about Mallusk's thriving night scene, Id be pretty sure its non existent. I wouldn't imagine it's a local hot spot, must not miss, but if it keeps the locals happy then who am I to complain?"
Whitehouse Working Mens Club,213-217 Shore Road Newtownabbey BT37 9SS,028 9085 1748,Social Clubs Pubs British,no_pricerate,no_website,1 review,"The Whitehouse Working Mens Club (a.k.a. The Workies) is, as far as I've seen, a bar which is predominantly reserved for locals (if you're not a member you have to sign in upon arrival ) but the wee old man who sits at the front desk is the best of banter (He used to be my milk man!) he's still very pleasant and accommodating.  ||| The bar certainly can get busy over the weekends but I'd say it's pretty quiet for the rest of the time. It's a good bar for an older crowd to enjoy a quiet drink at the weekend. The bar itself is split in to various floors and sections so you can experience different surroundings. It's nothing fancy but no over the top airs or graces. It does what it says on the tin, a club for working (wo)men to come relax, have a drink or a meal.  ||| The restaurant has only opened a short while ago (then closed, apparently over row with chef, now reopened under new management) and although it is now a little more pricey it still does the same job. You can come and enjoy your Friday lunch here and won't have to worry about breaking the bank. You won't come any where near.  ||| Bonus, did I mention how cheap the pints are? Your round! Cheers!"
Thyme Cafe,319 Antrim Road Newtownabbey BT36 5,no_phone,Sandwiches,no_pricerate,no_website,3 reviews,"Thyme is a wee cafe situated smack bang in the middle of Glengormley.   I feel awkward reviewing it... you know when you find somewhere that you want to keep all to yourself?  If I chuff on about how charming this place is, maybe it'll end up being inundated and I won't get my usual table... ||| Anyway.  I challenge any of you to find me a better coffee anywhere. That's a bold statement, isn't it? Forget about Starbucks and all that nonsense... When it comes to a good coffee, love in preparation is what matters. Love. Not firing out 3000 lattes per hour. ||| You'll normally find me here, just either side of the lunchtime rush (there seem to be a load of solicitors nearby) enjoying a sandwich or salad (and a latté, of course) in nice, genuinely lovely surroundings. Highly, highly recommended. ||| Thyme is a tiny little café that does an amazing chocolate milkshake. I go here sometimes whenever I am in the centre of the village and have about 30 minutes or so to spare. It does a lovely lunch menu. It is strange that there are not more little places like this around Belfast, little locally owned cafes and it is unfortunate that this is not so.  ||| The best meal I have ever had here has to be their B.L.T sandwich. It is one of the best sandwiches I have ever. Made on brown rye bread and made with freshly made bacon it was spectacular. There soups are often pretty good as well. A worthwhile little place to stop in if you are ever hungry! ||| One of the few little eateries in Glengormley - and although I live in this area, I don't usually socialise in it, or partake of the local restaurants or cafes, I'm usually heading into Belfast city centre or somewhere in North Belfast proper. But recently I met up with some friends who live locally and we ended up here having some lunch and a chat - it was a bit of a meeting too, regarding a project we are working on, and Thyme was definitely a nice place to do this. The food was really nice, and the staff weren't funny about us sitting for a while after we had long finished our food - and got chatting and lost track of time. It's a small cafe, but well run, and has a pleasant atmosphere. I'm glad I have found somewhere as nice as this so near where I live. I will definitely be going back for another bite to eat soon."
Cod House,337 Antrim Rd Newtownabbey BT36 5DZ,028 9083 3555,Fish & Chips,£,no_website,3 reviews,"Not the most amazing fish and chips I've ever had. The premises are bright and inviting, so it tends to promise great things, and I'm not usually of high expectations for a fast food place - all I really want are crispy chips and batter that has a good consistency and flavour - and good quality fish that melts in your mouth. It didn't really deliver on that to be honest, the batter was a bit bland, it lacked that sweetness that you can get in a good batter - and there wasn't a lot of 'fish' to the erm, well, fish. But the staff were really nice and the food was ready fairly promptly - so I'm not going to berate them for it - it wasn't awful, I've just had better experiences having fish and chips. ||| We eat in this place regularly as the food is good quality, unfortunately when it comes to the staff and the taking of orders the quality ends. It got to the stage we're stopped using them (which for us and them is unfortunate), 80% of our orders either have missing items of parts of it are wrong. This evening I collected an order and came home, guess what! part of the order was missing, so I called them and explained the situation, I was told I would have to come round and collect as they are busy, my reply was, ""so am I!"" An hour and a half late my order arrived, guess what? It was wrong, so I called again, what is the problem now? I started the tell the old woman with the attitude whom I would assume is one of the owners because I'm not entirely sure how anyone with an attitude like hers towards customers would ever get a job! It stinks!!! She hung up the phone on me, the younger girl, fair play to her tried to resolve the issue by explaining they were busy etc, NO EXCUSS!!! Get more staff or close. I was made to feel like the whole episode was my fault and I should just except what I was given, ""Amazing customer service!"" Needless to say what they sent to me was put in the bin. NEVER AGAIN! Their driver needs to be nominated for an award he's a gentleman, obviously has the patience of a saint. ||| My son and his wife visited me last night and called into The Cod House on thier way. They bought 3 fish suppers and when they arrived at my house a few minutes later we transferred them to plates. The batter on the fish was hard on one side and the chips were hard and dried out, as if they'd been reheated a number of times. Very little was eaten and approx 90% went in the bin. That's my first and last meal from THE COD HOUSE."

My favourite is the 1a meal with a double egg on top, mmm tasty :) House special curry with fried rice is another favourite :) ||| I've tried a lot of Chinese takeways in the area, and when it comes to the quality of the food, I'd recommend Greencastle. It seems Chinese restaraunts have trouble producing nice chips, but Greencastle have them nailed. The portions aren't the biggest, so personally, If I'm starving i'll phone somewhere else. However, nice food. Fairly speedly delivery apart from the expected delay on weekends. Thumbs-up."
The Khayber,373-375 Antrim Road Newtownabbey BT36 5EB,028 9084 9414,Indian Pakistani,££,thekhayber.com,7 reviews,"Despite the fact that my palette isn't designed to handle any kind of spice, I actually love Indian food. I'm the kind of heathen that orders a korma though, so I'm by no means an expert! ||| I've eaten in the Khayber twice - both times were takeaways, so I can't comment on the waiter service in the restaurant. Although I would agree that the lighting is a bit of an issue. It's so dark in there that I wouldn't fancy sitting in it for ages...might get a bit depressing... ||| As for the food, I loved it. It was all really well cooked and properly tasty, so with that in mind, I wouldn't have any reservations about ordering from it again in the future. ||| We had a 3 course lunch here yesterday for £8.95-starter, main with rice and coffee. Great selection of starters and main courses. The portions were smaller than the a la carte, but for a quick lunch they were perfect. I had 2 pieces of succulent lamb tikka and side salad which was delicious. For main I had chicken tikka jalfrezi and asked for it to be very spicy. This was served with pilau rice. It was spicy and very tasty, rich and creamy-Not what a jalfrezi should have been but very nice none the less. The other diners had a dopiazza and Rogan josh which again were creamy and not how they should have been, but we finished them and did enjoy them. We had proper coffee with cream to finish. I would like to see the dishes be more authentic in the future. ||| Not a fan. I've heard some superb reviews about how out of this world The Khyber is. I was sorely disappointed. Not once, but twice did they get our order wrong. It wasn't like it was that difficult, there was only two of us, we both ordered the same thing, and they didn't get either right...How does that even work?  I thought, OK, maybe they're having a bad day. So after a while I decided that everyone deserves a second chance, the next time we decided to order take away, they got that wrong too. The food was ... ok.... by no mean standards. The naan bread was dry (big disappointment) and the korma wasn't quite how I would expect. I'm a huge Indian fan so I was gutted when all this happened. i would love more excellent Indian restaurants around the area.  ||| I wanted to give the place a chance but now I'll stick to The Kinara thanks very much. ||| Mrs M and I decided to have a change from our usual Indian (of the Ocean variety) restaurant last time we were out, before heading off to the cinema, and thought we'd give the long established Khyber a try.  ||| Chances are we're biased, due to our love of a very close rival, but neither of us were particularly impressed. Especially myself, given that I didn't get to see much of the film afterwards, as I was otherwise occupied with some 'psychedellic yodelling' (as the awful Viz Profanisaurus puts it) in the gents' loo for a while.  ||| The interior looks a bit dusty, dark and dated. No faulting the service or the menu, but if you end up barfing a few hours after you eat somewhere, what are the odds of you ever going back? ||| The Khyber is one of my earliest memories of eating Indian food. It's been around for a very long time and for the longest time, I'd never heard of another sit in Indian restaurant and we went there a lot (times have changed!). Their menu is full of the usual Indian dishes that us Westerners would have heard of. I always got their madras, one down from their devastating Vindaloo and it was always amazing, especially the vegetarian version. It can get a little costly once you take into account the prices for all the sides, but that appears to be the trend with all Indian restaurants. One problem I have with this place is their fascination with the 50watt light bulb. If it was a little brighter it would be five stars. ||| The Khyber Restaurant is where I first fell in love with Indian food, and the first place I had ever been to that made a Vindaloo so hot, it made me see stars. They know what they are doing when it comes to Indian cuisine, and are aware of how to cater for a western palate as well. The menu has all the favourites with a few lesser known dishes for the more adventurous among us. ||| Although The Khyber does a take away service, its sit-in restaurant is where it really shines through. The waiters are knowledgeable about their dishes and can recommend something to suit anyone. It is maybe a little too dark for some people in the restaurant, but this I feel adds to the flavour of the place. Try the garlic nan, which is out of this world. I am honestly getting hungry just writing about this place! ||| The hubby and I were sitting in on Saturday, thinking about what to have for dinner, but it was such a lovely evening that we decided to head out for a meal locally - and due to my Yelping enthusiasm these days, of course we had to try somewhere new. We always usually head to the Indian Ocean when we fancy that cuisine, but we decided to go here instead as we'd never been before. It looks like absolutely nothing special from the outside, and the décor inside is a little dated in my personal opinion, quite dark and heavy - but very Indian and traditional at the same time. The staff weren't up to scratch in my opinion - what I mean by that is they did all they were supposed to but they never looked you in the eye and no smiles or even a welcome, it was all very dull, like they didn't want to be there...if they don't look happy to be there, why should the customers? Also when I asked for a glass of Pinot Grigio, the waiter then instantly deferred to my husband, as though I hadn't spoken, and told him there was no Pinot Grigo and what the other options were - as if he expected hubby to choose for me! I was not impressed with that. What I was impressed with however, was the food - it was absolultely gorgeous and hot and the chicken (Bhuna) that I had was tender and there was a good amount of meat in the sauce. Their peshwari naan was lovely too and the portios were all good. The bill came to around £45 which was good considering we both had starters and two drinks each. The food will bring me back for a takeaway, but the service was not pleasant."
Thunderdome Cafe,2 Farrier Ct Antrim Rd Newtownabbey BT36 7XB,028 9034 2266,American (Traditional),££,no_website,10 reviews,"Back again to the home-land and have been here already this week, yum!!  ||| Food was top class as was service.  Try it - you won't be disappointed!! ||| This place was our 2nd date, it used to be our favourite place to eat.  The last time we came home (2 yrs ago, 2010), we ate there and left hugely disappointed and disgusted at how bad it had gotten in there.   ||| We've been home 3.5 weeks, and we've already in there about 4 or 5 times (though we're slightly devastated that the car has gone!)  It's a great place, food is delicious, portions are great, service is great and the atmosphere is great too.  ||| We've also been during football games, £2.80 a pint until the first goal goes in, so, when certain teams are playing, you could have a cheap enough night out ;) ||| Love it here :) ||| Dined in the newly named Trinity resturaunt. The place itself was nice  but nothing outstanding. We had to wait quite a while for our food, even though there where only another two people dining. Fairly decent selection on the menu but quite expensive. Myself and my daughter had the chicken curry which was lovely and a good sized portion. My little one was given a child's menu with pictures of fruit shoot on it but we where told that the price did not include the drink. The kids menu was basic.  Overall I found it hard to get my head around the attempt at a fine dining experience in what was once known as an American diner. Not a bad experience but nothing to make me want to return. ||| Nothing special here. Usual beer you find anywhere, got a few pool tables though which is good. Prices are average and so is the building / decor.  ||| Was here for a friends birthday party and they provided  a buffet service, the food was pretty good! Especially the chicken which is always a win! Overall all verdict........ not bad ||| I visited Trinity (Thunderdome) back when it had just opened (didn't have Tripadvisor then!!!). I had the chicken stack with garlic potatoes and really loved it. The service was great, the portion size generous, the taste was amazing. It was well priced also. It's worth hunting out!! ||| Amazing food as always, staff are always kind and putting the customer 1st for every need, a lot of places fail to do that, but even with the restaurant being in the new Trinity building it's lovely with a touch of homeliness, love this place so much I've been twice in one week. 10 out of 10 for everything. ||| I hate being too negative, so I'll start with the things I like about the Thunderdome. ||| It's near my house. Always a bonus! ||| The staff are all lovely and so the service is usually faultless. ||| It's very family friendly. There's lots to look at, so it's a good place to take the kids. It's also pretty big, so there's room for them to run around if needs be! ||| Now the things I don't so much like about the Thunderdome. ||| The food is never fresh. It always tastes microwaved, an if you've read any of my other reviews, I HATE this in a restaurant. ||| It's very expensive for what you get, in my opinion. Now, they do an early bird special. If you order before 6, your main is £6, which is pretty cheap. If you don't get it at that price, expect to pay a tenner for a burger and chips. ||| I've never been to one of the shows they have in the Thunderdome. In all honesty it's not my thing, so I can't imagine myself going anytime soon either. ||| All in all, the Thunderdome does its job. Being in the middle of Glengormley, it's never going to be a fantastic, modern, haute cuisine restaurant, but the food could be better, especially for the price people are asked to pay. ||| The Thunderdome.  Oh dear, oh dear.  Like Judith, the previous reviewer of this place, I don't like to be negative about a business.  People have put love into it, maybe the staff feel strongly about it.  But... ||| The building itself is an eyesore.  The interior isn't much better.  Primarily designed for families - lots of stuff for hyperactive children to gawp at - when me and my clan were in, they had the Cartoon Network on TV!!  I felt uncomfortable and was in a bit of a hurry to leave, to be honest. ||| Waiter:  What's your order, Sir? ||| Me: I'll have the rump steak medium rare, please. ||| Waiter: Sorry Sir, but we cook all of our steaks well-done... ||| Me: What?!  Balls to this, I'm out of here. ||| I didn't really say that last sentence, but the rest of the conversation really did take place.  I'm too polite.  I ate my strip of leather and said thank you when I left. ||| I'm certainly not going back though. ||| Tunderdome cafe is like the Springsteen's of Botanic in my opinion. It seems to have put a lot of effort into its surroundings and not much thought into it's menu. I suppose I might think this because this place isn't catered towards me. It's mostly for families to take their kids and distract them with bright colours and loud noises just long enough for the parents to have a non interrupted meal. The food is very much like American style diner food, just burgers, fries etc. These items aren't too bad. I wouldn't come here and spend that little extra getting the steak because you know if there's an average burger, then it's better/cheaper than an average steak. Great for families and their kids, but that's it. ||| Thunderdome Cafe is the kind of place that you want to take children. It's loud, colourful and could easily keep any hyper active 6 year old busy for 45 minutes. My parent's used it most years for my sister's birthday party between the ages of 7 - 11, and the restaurant certainly catered well for them. It does a basic restaurant menu and the food is ok, though nothing you would write home about. |||  It seems that the decor of the place is where most effort has been put. If you have ever been to a Hard Rock cafe or a Planet Hollywood then you pretty much know exactly how the inside of the Thunderdome will look like. From the motorbike in the front window, to the 'collectables' that litter the walls, the place is overflowing with weird and sometimes interesting bric-a-brac.  ||| It's not somewhere you would want to take the love of your life, but if you have a few kids then maybe it could be the place for you. ||| I've heard and met lots of people who don't like it in here at all. Now, it's definitely not for a romantic night out, or even a chilled out night out - we went before going onwards to a concert elsewhere in the city, and we went because it was local, handy and reasonably priced. The food is straightforward, nothing to write home about - I had chicken Maryland and chips followed by pavlova. It wasn't horrible, just kind of mediocre - but I was happy enough to pay for it. The main took quite a while to arrive also, but when it did it was satisfying. It's kind of making an attempt at the 'Hard Rock Cafe' vibe, and doesn't quite pull it off, because let's face it, it's in Glengormley and it isn't trying hard enough. It's okay if you want to bring the kids for a quick Saturday afternoon feed. Steer clear if you like quality dining."

It was my dad's treat as someone he worked with had told him it was good! ||| It's situated in Glengormley which isn't that far from us so didn't take too long to get there. When we arrived my first impressions were that it was a converted outhouse, however we were warmly greeted and shown to our table. ||| There was only the 4 of us, plus one other table of two there when we visited so service was really quick. ||| I had a look at the menu, and there was only one thing I really fancied, which they told me they didn't have any left of when it came to taking our order. Cue a slight panic from me as I hadn't seen anything else. ||| Thankfully, the lady serving us, offered to make something up which wasn't on the menu, which I really appreciated. ||| All in all the experience was good here. They also do private room hire for functions and have the occasional family fun day too."

Nice one! ||| I was unsure what to expect from this chip shop, but seeing that it's advertised in so many roundabouts in Glengormley I really had to give it a go. I was not disappointed. The shop is really clean and well put together. The food gets to you quick and fresh, I noticed that they only started to fry the chips after I placed my order, so they were not sitting about going stale, and therefore they taste incredible.  ||| The best part of my experience at the chippie was their 'big foot' hot dog, a foot long pork sausage (not a frankfurter) with relish, onions and ketchup for £2.70.  I was amazed that I managed to finish it, but as it was so nice, it was really hard to stop eating. I would ask anyone that ever goes here to try it. It is really that great."

I have eaten in the lounge bar (which is nicely seperate from the public bar) once, and the food was very nice, i had the ribeye which was delicious and the missus had scampi which she also enjoyed, the service was very good and it wasnt exactly dear with 3 courses for about a tenner. so its a lovely little spot that ill be returning to soon!! ||| Tom's Bar and Fluid are nothing special, as you would have guessed.. but I quite like the vibe in both premises.  ||| There is a sense of community, the staff are very friendly and if you go often enough, you will notice the regulars coming in and out and in Tom's, they actually have paintings up of all their regulars.  ||| Prices are reasonable.. although if they were a little less, it may help to bring in more people.  ||| Overall, it's alright if you want a drink in your local area and not wanting to travel far. Also okay if you are only wanting a couple of drinks or an hour or two.. but not the whole night."

I met a friend for lunch. We were served complimentary water in customised porcelain/rubber stopped bottle and glasses with the Knags logo. He had lunch-I an Americano coffee. The coffee was fab,had it with cream.  ||| My mate had chicken tikka pita pocket with salad and sweet potato fries. The fries and salad were lovely, as was the garlic sauce over the chicken however the chicken was not chicken tikka, more like fried spiced chicken! ||| The place was spotless, great staff and reasonable price with a super menu selection. ||| I am so so disappointed  I was looking forward to trying this place as I'd heard so much buzz about it.  ||| The food itself was delicious, service was glacial though - clearly not enough staff to handle the lunchtime rush and with a small child in tow, keeping him entertained for that length of time just wasn't easy.  ||| Got the worst food poisoning of my life the following morning. It couldn't have come from anywhere else. As expected, the manager vehemently denied it was his chicken, or the bacon in the veggies. But I won't be back. ||| Tried this little place for breakfast/brunch this morning, very nice and reasonable prices. The service was very also friendly. ||| I had the french toast with sausage (bacon also an option), my mum had pancakes and my dad had their 3 egg omelette. They both were very happy with their food.  ||| It's a picky point but for me they lose a star because they don't have any maple syrup to go with the french toast or pancakes!! ||| I dined hear with my family to celebrate my brothers birthday, in all there were 8 of us which included 2 children. ||| Overall the service was lovely with one waitress in particular providing exemplary service, however some things could have been improved and hence the star is lost. We ordered the children's main meals to come with our starters and unfortunately they didn't arrive until we had finished, no big deal you might think but when 2 kids are looking at you longingly whilst you are eating it can be off putting   ||| All the adults ordered a starter, I had the chicken Caesar salad which was packed with chunks of chicken and bacon, and really quite a big portion. ||| My main was the peppered chicken stack which whilst was nice wasn't really a 'stack' to speak of but simply just a chicken breast with tobacco onions on top I had dined here before and had this main and I have to say it was a lot bigger. ||| Saying that however I was stuffed to the brim and couldn't even fit in any desserts which some of the party managed. ||| Knags is a lovely restaurant and even though it was very busy we managed to get a booking for 8 people at short notice which was great, and even though some things about the service were not ideal the one waitress who mainly served our table was second to none and managed to save the day. ||| A great place to try wholesome food and one my family enjoys going back to."

Captain's Table,11 Carnmoney Road Newtownabbey BT36 6HL,028 9083 2265,Takeaway & Fast Food,£,no_website,5 reviews,"This place does a great family takeaway meal. For only £10.00 it includes  ||| 4 sausages  ||| 2 pasties ||| Chicken strips  ||| 2 large chips ||| 1 gravy  ||| 1 curry sauce ||| Good for the price and plenty to eat.  ||| Have had to ask a few times that everything is cooked a little longer as sometimes it can look a little pasty lol.  ||| You can sit in too. Good sized portions and lots to choose from ||| The Captain's Table is a pretty much faultless fish'n'chip place on the Carnmoney Road of Glengormley.  One can sit in, in the nice atmosphere of the café bit, or take away.  I've done the latter many times when the place has been rammed, and the staff are always super-organised and speedy. ||| I seems to me that everybody has very strong (often misguided) feelings about their favourite chippy.  But I'd challenge anybody to point me towards a local place that's better than here.  Unlike the previous reviewers, I've been fortunate enough to never catch the staff in a bad mood - quite the opposite, in fact.  They've been friendly to me and and my family when we've sat in or taken away. ||| The fish is superb.  They seem to understand  that big, whopping whacks of cod can be overcooked and horrible, and they always do it perfectly.  Their pasties (a chippy should be closely scrutinised by the quality of said products) seem to be made in-house and are really tasty. ||| Nothing healthy on offer but hey, what do you want from a chippy?  Well worth a try, in my humble opinion. ||| This place is somewhat of an institution around the area and you can often find lots of the locals enjoying a fish supper on a Friday night. It is an incredibly relaxed place, being a mix between both a take away and a sit-in cafe, and very good value for money, and good portion sizes ensure that you never go away disappointed. |||  The service is fast and efficient, although sometimes the staff can be a little moody. They do almost anything you could think of that you would want from a takeaway, including a fairly decent selection of pizzas. The chips are probably not the best you can get in the area but they certainly are probably some of the cheapest. |||  Unfortunately the Captain's Table does not do deliveries, but it is certainly worth a trip to try it out. Try their gravy too, it's pretty great. ||| I've eaten in at the Captains Table a number of times as one of my friends used to live nearby, and we would usually go here for a cheap sit in meal to give us something to do of an evening. ||| They do take out, and have a spacious enough area for sitting in, and it's always pretty packed, which I guess compliments its popularity. Despite this though, we never had any problems getting served, and I always found the staff to be reasonably friendly. Not exactly jumping for joy, but who is while they are at work! ||| They do all the usual food you would expect from a chip shop, chips, fish, burgers and suchlike (fish supper was my favourite, and as the others have mentioned, it's not the best chippy in the world, but it's still good, and cheap, which was good for me at the time, being a skint student! ||| The Captain's Table has been around under one banner (or flag?) or the other for as long as I can remember. Literally as long as I can remember. We used to go here every Friday when I was younger, but I don't really go anymore. ||| In fairness, it's not because the place isn't good, it is. It's just that there's a much better chippy across the road (The Thornton), and these things are all relative. ||| The food is good, but a little too greasy for me. Plus, I always slip on the floor - not a good look. Colm H is also right when he calls the staff out for being moody at times. Compared to their rival across the road, this place seems tired. ||| It is a sit-down restaurant as well though, so if you don't actually want your house smelling of fish supper, you can always sit in. The price is reasonable and you won't have any complaints. They also started doing home delivery about a year ago, which is pretty spiffy, given that they are the only fish and chip shop in Glengormley that offer that to the best of my knowledge."

Will defo be back again and will hopefully have room for dessert this time. ||| Would definitely recommend for value for money. Very impressed. ||| It's unfortunate I have to leave this 2 stars because the food was really good. We stayed at the hotel and ate lunch one day at the restaurant. The food was fabulous but the service was so confusing and all the wait staff just seemed overwhelmed and frazzled. After lunch they brought us the bill but never came back to get it so we just went to the hostess station ourselves- so weird. I attempted to get a bakery snack once and then attempted to order food a different time and could not believe the service. Multiple people just ignored me and when I approached them, they referred me to other people. This is absolutely ridiculous so I just went without eating. It's really too bad because the food was so good. ||| Corrs Corner is one of those places that's just always been there. I used to go all the time with my family when I was younger, and even these days, we'll go every now and then. ||| It's undergone a lot of refurbishment over the years, so now it's a pretty modern place, with a grill room/bar, a formal restaurant and a hotel with full conference facilities. ||| I can only really comment on the food, which is great. It's nothing life-changing, but as far as gastropubs go, it's pretty good. I always leave full to the brim and still wanting more!"

There are two branches of this café in Newtownabbey; one in the Abbey Centre and one in Glengormley. Both branches are frequented by local employees / staff from nearby shop on their lunch breaks who don't want to eat junk food or fast food, instead preferring the healthier option. Because of this it can mean that it gets very busy around noon / lunch time, but if you come later or earlier than this you'll generally find a great service, lovely staff and some scrummy sandwiches. It's a good option for the health conscious. Their dishes range from their gorgeous garlic sauté potatoes, substantial stews, mouth watering pizzas, plentiful pasta tubs (which come in a really good size) tempting toasties (my favourite!) lovely lasagne, I could go on but I'll leave it to you to go try it out. You can choose the greasy option, but if you like they'll make you up a superior salad bowl with stunning sauces or try one of the beautiful baked potatoes. Yum"
Papa's Kitchen,Febro Buildings Antrim Rd Unit 7 Glengormley Newtownabbey BT36 5EB,028 9080 0444,Takeaway & Fast Food,££,no_website,2 reviews,"Papas kitchen is a mediocre pizza parlour situated amongst the hordes of Glengormley take aways. A few years back when the area wasn't as popular Papa's would have been one of the main take aways in the area but due to the increasing growth and development in the area its beginning to be surrounded by various other eateries and restaurants with a significantly higher standard than what Papa's originally set. Without wanting to cause immediate competition I would recommend trying Pizzarella right next door. For great quality food you'd find a much better priced take away offering some amazing mid week deals. Don't let me be the judge, compare them yourself and you'll see what I mean. It's an easy winner. ||| When I was a kid I used to live for Papa's Kitchen's chicken nuggets. Now, in the days of Jamie Oliver, I dread to think what I was eating, but it was the 90s. We didn't know so much back then! ||| Over time, we stopped going to Papa's Kitchen and started going to other takeaways instead, but I revisited this place a few months ago and to be honest I wasn't that impressed. ||| It was ok, don't get me wrong. There was nothing offensive about it. It was just a bit...meh. ||| The chips were forgettable to say the least and it says a lot that I literally cannot remember what else I ordered! ||| With the amount of takeaways available in Glengormley, Papa's Kitchen has kind of faded away a bit over recent years. If I were you, I'd probably go to Pizzarella for all my pizza needs and the Thornton for chips."
Royal Thai,377 Antrim Road Glengormley BT36 5EB,028 9084 8189,Thai Chinese Takeaway & Fast Food,££,no_website,6 reviews,"I brought my two daughters here for dinner last night. They've never been here before. Simon and the staff were very friendly and helpful and seated us near the fish feature-my girls loved it!! ||| We went for a kids chicken fried rice, kids chicken chow mein, Bangkok seafood (me), chips and curry sauce. We had complimentary prawn crackers and curry sauce to start and the girls loved these as they were warm, crispy and tasty. ||| The kids dishes came out and I actually had to question whether they were kids or adults as the portion size was big!! They tucked into their meals and then mine arrived followed by chips and sauce. The food was superb, portion sizes amazing and service excellent. Definitely worth a trip to Glengormley for good, authentic, Chinese and Thai cuisine and all for £30!!! ||| I visited here on a trip that I made a few months ago and absolutely loved the food. The owners are incredibly warm and it's clear they put a lot of love into their restaurant. The food is delicious and well prepared. The environment is clean and wonderful. ||| The Royal Thai - bit of a misnomer this, as there doesn't seem to be anything regal about this place. ||| Like a lot of buildings in Glengormley, it seems to be compulsory to let the exterior fall into a mess of disrepair.  It's not very attractive to say the least. ||| Quite charming inside though - nicely lit, and the staff all look the part.  I had an awesome bowl of tom yum gai last time I was there...  Surely one of the world's greatest dishes.  I tend to turn into Captain Tomato Head any time I eat anything with chilli in it, and our waitress quite charmingly kept asking me if I was OK.  I then had scallops for my main course, which were as scallops should be...  lightly cooked and tender.   My wife certainly had no complaints with her courses either. ||| You know, I would recommend this place.  They have very reasonable lunch deals on, and the food and service are faultless.  Please just ignore the minging exterior. ||| After unsuccessfully hoking around in the fridge for some appetising tea a few nights ago, we decided we'd have to 'settle' for a Chinese (heaven forbid!) Now usually I order religiously from the Good Fortune (see review) but I decided to try somewhere different for a change. Friends had been to the sit in part of this restaurant last week and said they enjoyed their meal, so we thought we'd try it on their recommendation. Well, I won't be making that mistake again. I can't vouch for the restaurant, maybe they take more time and effort over preparing their dishes, but I was really let down by what I was served from the take away. We ordered; chicken with satay sauce (and a half & half) and the special chow mein. I'll give them their dues the chicken satay was quite nice (nothing special) but that's about where it ends. The chips weren't even worthy of being called chips, neither was the rice. My special chow mein, well, the noodles tasted like half cooked super noodles, the chicken part of the dish, ew, I don't even want to think about it; it was like a straggly, rubbery, gooey excuse for meat. Nasty. We ended up leaving most of our meals it was that bad. I'll know for again to stick to what I know!  ||| **Maybe I got an off night, which possibly could be the case given the previous reivews ** ||| I've eaten here many times, and I always enjoy the food. It doesn't look like much from the outside, it looks a little sad actually, but inside they actually have made quite an effort with the interior decor, with snazzy lighting, sparkly glass beaded curtains and a modern looking indoor fishpond...although the waterfall in it does make you feel the need to pee sometimes. ||| I've had the honey chilli chicken here, the crispy chilli squid, and the duck pancakes...all lovely. The service is good too - a little hilarious though sometimes - the last time we went the waitress insisted on taking our orders without writing them down, which seemed madness to us as there was 25 of us! But she got them all perfect and the food arrived quickly. The honey chilli chicken that time was VERY hot - probably a bit much for some palates, but I loved it. Reasonable prices too. They also have a private room for hire with Karaoke. Never tried it, but it could be interesting... ||| A little bit of an institution in Glengormley The Royal Thai is both a great restaurant and a great take away. They do all the classics including a spectacular Thai Green Curry, and the speed of some of the cooking is unbelievable. However saying that, all the curries are made with a supreme amount of care and attention. ||| I often like to try this place as a little bit of a change from a chip shop or even Chinese. It adds a little bit of diversity in Glengormley which is already well over stocked with takeaways, so its success proves that not only is it a special little place, but the food is of a high standard also"

My 5 year old daughter, wife and I dined and we were missing my 9 year old, who was at a friends party but gave us strict instructions to bring her back a pepperoni pizza!! ||| I've dined in the original Mama Masala Londonderry (owned by the same owners)  and really enjoyed it so was looking forward to tasting the food! I've been following the journey of this new restaurant avidly (Metamorphosis ) and have written about the Story. ||| Whilst we looked at the extensive Indian and Italian menu we nibbled on fresh, crisp poppadoms served with three sweet dips/chutneys. The menu was a very well thought out and well designed one and there were plenty of dishes to choose from!! ||| We chose Vegetable samosa and garlic prawns to start and my little one wanted her chicken nuggets and chips!! My wife also had a mojito which she said was delicious. The presentation of both the prawns and samosas was very elegant and appetising. The 2 large king prawns were served butterflied, with tails on and in a rich, garlic sauce and were amazing. The three filo samosas looked a bit oily and when we cut into them discovered they had meat in them. We flagged this up and the staff were very apologetic and the proprietor Gagan personally served us fluffy perfect Punjabi vegetable samosas. These were exactly like one gets in Punjab itself and delicious suffice to say!! The portion size and taste of the nuggets and chips was excellent. ||| For main course my wife opted for the chicken penne and I the rara gosht with Mama Masala Nan. When these were served it was quite literally a ""wow"" moment. The pasta was served in a large dish, the lamb in a deep oval dish and there was plenty in each. What really struck us was the authenticity, the very generous quality meat content (chicken breast, lots of tender chunks of lamb interspersed with minced lamb or keema) and the flavours!!! The pasta was in a creamy, yet not too heavy sauce with a nice touch of sun dried tomatoes and basil. The rara gosht is certainly one of the best Indian dishes I've ever had, even my wife loved it and she's not a big lamb eater. The nan was soft, full of flavour (Chillies and coriander) and was ideal with the lamb and pasta!! The dish was full of flavour and spice and not oily or sweet or artificially coloured. This was the real McCoy!!  ||| Our waiter remembered that we had ordered a pepperoni pizza to take and he duly presented it to us as we were leaving. ||| The venue was superb, the staff were tremendous and the food was exceptional. I can now say that this will be a firm favourite of ours and is highly commended!!"
Stacks Bistro,628 Antrim Road Newtownabbey BT36 4RF,04428 9083 3932,Coffee & Tea Shops Breakfast & Brunch,£,no_website,1 review,"Ok I am updating my review. I have always rated this place as nice but my experience was very different this time. ||| I ordered a Cesar salad. OK a salad! How can you get it wrong. Well I thought that until today.  ||| I was given a plate with practically no lettuce. Soggy, greasy, battered chicken. It did not state that the chicken was battered! The bacon was full of fat. Crispy fat wouldn't have been so bad bit this wasn't the case. Two large portions of cheddar cheese placed at either side and onions placed in a pile. ||| Now if you look at my reviews I very rarely complain. I do love food! After the second mouthful I had to return it as it was really not nice. The waitress said that the kitchen was closed and thay there was nothing else. She also tod ne that this was the way they serve the cesar salad. Nowhere on the menu stated that this was  different from a traditional cesar. Even if it had said a Stacks Cesar I would have questioned it.  |||  I was not charged for it as I had not eaten it but was left sitting hungry while my two children finished there meals. Even if the kitchen was closed I an sure they could have found some unbattered chicken to throw into another salad.  |||  Not a happy customer! ||| After a late night out drinking I needed a big fry up to soak up everything from the night before. We decided to try Stacks as it's only round the corner from us.  |||  There's certainly nothing fancy about this place but it is clean and the waitress who served us was fantastic! We both ordered the large fry and a portion of beans each which was served separately. I prefer this cause I am picky where my beans mix.  |||  A cup of tea/coffee is included in the price.  |||  Overall a good breakfast!  I couldn't believe the price , it was only £11.50 for 2x large frys, 2× portions of beans 2x coffee and a hot chocolate! Will definitely return. |||  During the evening they do pizzas and it's BYO. I think the kids would enjoy it too."

New Taste,7 Carnmoney Rd Glengormley Newtownabbey BT36 6HL,028 9084 0330,Chinese,no_pricerate,no_website,3 reviews,"I would estimate that about 99% of all Chinese takeaways, in Belfast, are exactly the same. I have always loved the authentic Chinese food that I've tasted, but the fact that there are some junctions or small areas in Belfast that have loads of takeaway joints all firing out gravy half & halfs to people who don't know any better just makes me feel like crying.  ||| Does anybody ever try to do anything new or originally Chinese? Such a huge country with millennia of fascinating culinary history.  ||| New Taste on the Carnmoney Road is at least a bit different; they claim to offer authentic lime curry, Korean and Mongolian stuff, all of which I've tried, as well as the usual suspects. The Mongolian sauce is the most memorable - spicy beef with a dollop of soured yoghurt on top. And while properly-made Satay is one of the most amazing (and easy to make) things on the face of the Planet Earth, New Taste's is still gravy made from a bought-in commercial base.  ||| But, at least they make a wee bit of an effort to do something different from all the usual rubbish. ||| We have always ordered form Nwlew taste but this was definitely our last time. On a couple of occasions we've waited for nearly two hours for a delivery that we were told would take 30 mins. The lady on the phone was lovely so we just forgot about it. Tonight I ordered crispy, honey chilli beef from the menu. What I received was a very bland ordinary beef dish. Not crispy or like honey chiil at all. I phoned and was told that it's the way it should be!!!!!!! Def not! I would have been happy to keep it if it was at least tasty but it was completely bland. They have re delivered another dish, chicken Satay and ince again it is awful. I've had this dish before and it's always good. We will absolutely never order again from here. You've just lost a good customer!! ||| Forget your order! ||| Lie to you about it (not even convincingly)! ||| Ordered food and was told 1 hour to delivery. ||| 2 hours later still no food. ||| Phoned to ask where it was - told ""It's on its way! Just left!"". VERY ABRUPT! VERY RUDE! ||| Food arrived 20 minutes later (spring rolls scalding hot straight from the fryer! I.e not 20 minutes from the fryer!) ||| I live half a mile from the restaurant so my only conclusion can be:- |||      They forgot my order; |||      They lied to me when I phoned to find out where the food was; |||      They cooked my order after having been reminded; |||      They then delivered the frreshly cooked food over 1 and a half hours late! ||| When I phoned to complain about this abysmal lack of service they hung up on me 3 times before I could make a complaint! ||| Do not go near this restaurant!

So I've been to this Holland & Barrrett store a lot more recently than I ever would have before, and each time I've been here I have been more than pleased with the service I've been given. The staff here must go through some strict training as they all seem to know so much about all their products! Good for them though, I would imagine that there would be nothing more annoying than coming in here seeking advice and the staff knowing les than you did! So I firmly trust the help and advice Holland & Barrrett give. They so a huge range of vitamins, health food, weight gain/loss aids and so on. If you're interested in any of the products they stock then all you need to do is talk to one of the staff who will be more than glad to help."

Good selection of lunches, sandwiches, soups . ||| I've lived around this area since I was born and I've always thought there should be a coffee shop in this area. Now there is, hooray, but I have to say I'm a little let down. I thought it would be nicer. Now I've only been in a few times, but I just don't feel drawn back to the place. Yes the service was polite and friendly, their wares sold for standard  prices, regulars seem at ease (it seems to be frequented by local shop workers) though I'd say it would be a good shop if you're passing by and don't fancy coffee in the Abbey Centre (who could blame you!) They also sell a range of hand made cards and at least the staff know about the coffee they sell.  ||| I don't want to knock it as I've finally got what I wanted but it could definitely be a lot better with just a little effort. ||| Stopped in about a dozen times over my most recent visit to see family in December 2014.  Very much enjoyed the coffee drinks and lunches.  The staff was very accommodating of my wife's GF needs.  I enjoyed the soup, various sandwiches and the Cappuccino ||| Best coffee and cakes in Newtownabbey.

Used to be on a Friday night my friends and I would get the vodka in, go to the video store and rent a movie, then head to The Crescent for a good old dirty chippy. Ah those were the days! ||| Their chicken burgers are nearly the size of my head, no joke! They're scrummy! You really can't get a better burger anywhere else. The chicken is unbelievable juicy, completely tender and battered to perfection. They also make the nicest curry cheesy chips (I'm sure some of you reading this will be thinking, curry? and cheese? What? But really, don't knock it until you've tried it. Then you can thank me, you're welcome in advance by the way!) ||| And so we move on to the battered Mars Bars. Now, I know this is a controversial subject, a bit like Marmite, you either love it or hate it, but personally, I'm a lover (of Mars Bars, definitely not Marmite) and I dread to think that some of you poor souls won't even have heard of the greatness that is the battered Mars Bar. If this is the case, go to the Crescent right now and get one. It's one of those, you must try these before you die. You will not regret it!"

It's clean, basic and spacious. The kids always love the lunchtime buffet. All you can eat pizza, pasta and salad. It's a good price for the buffet and in this branch they keep the fresh pizza coming regularly. I have been to others and you have to wait for ages for a fresh one. The pizzas are fairly tasty if you get to them when they are just brought out. Again the pasta is ok but if left to sit then it bacomes all dried up. Sometimes there os plenty of salad choices, other days not so good. There lettuce is ussually a bit limp so not the freshest. The staff are pleasant and it's a spacious place, not too cramped. The kids always want ice cream after. It's unlimited and I only order one bowl between the two. There's no point ordering two if you can fill it as much as you like!   |||  I do like this place and I go back time and time again but I definitely don't feel it's worthy of more than 3 star's ||| First time I've been here in well over a year wasn't happy with it last time but now they have upped there game and gotten so much better food was cooked to perfection and desert was amazing too defo be back soon"

I ordered food tonight at 7:40 ( regular customer ) was told it would be with me shortly, which I was surprised at as it was a Saturday night. 1 hour passed no food , so I rang and was assured the food had left and was on its way. 40 mins later no food so I rang again but was continuously engaged. When I finally got through I told the girl I'd waited 2 hours and I wasn't happy (no reply) I then told her to cancel the order, phone her driver and pass my compliant to her manager ! Her reply was ""ok""! ||| Will go elsewhere! ||| I've said before about how much I LOVE Indian food, so when I discovered *shock horror* that The Sahara had closed down, and unfortunately my favourite Kinara don't deliver I resorted to the advice of my fellow Yelpers and decided to try out the Shaheen Tandoori Indian. Well, well, well, I wasn't let down (Thanks guys!) and I was delivered one of the nicest Indian meals I've had in a long time. I opted for the chilli, garlic masala, onion bahjee, and a cauliflower dish (I don't eat rice or bread so I get to be greedy!) and everything was just delicious. As one dish was particularly spicy I was glad the other provided a creamy, mild taste so I could alternate if the spice was too much for me! Definitely somewhere I'll be trying again.

The salted chilli chicken balls and satay sauce were very nice. It seemed clean to me and you could watch them cook. Worth a try! ||| On Tuesday 18th I had the misfortune to walk into this place and purchase sweet and sour pork and honey chilli chicken.  Really I should have had more sense when I saw the two young boys blundering round the kitchen looking like younger versions of Manuel from Faulty Towers, but as I have had food before from there and it was OK I stupidly went ahead. ||| The chips were like rubber, and cold.  The stir fried vegetables that came with the pork were actually raw onion and raw red and green peppers.  The pork itself was 99% fat, and the whole thing was cold.  Normally Im not a fussy eater and can scarf well nigh anything, but this got scraped into the bin (I didn't want to give the dog stomach upset). ||| I thought I would give the owner/manager a chance to resolve things, and gave him a call, explaining that I had literally had to scrape £15.00 worth of food into the bin.......now if he knew anything about Customer Service he could have kept my custom, and I would have recommended Totos, as anyone can have an off night, but his suggestion that he would ""give me a bit of discount off my next order"", was frankly ludicrous, I was not going to throw good money after bad. ||| A proper way to handle my complaint would have been to apologise profusely for my waste of time driving over, and to send a perfectly cooked dish to my door, so I would have got what I'd paid for.  Since speaking to others its clear that this place has gone way downhill, it only has one star for hygiene, and the food is appalling. ||| I have never ever wrote a review but this place nearly killed me tonight.

Fountain House,484a Antrim Rd Newtownabbey BT36 5DA,028 9080 4466,Chinese,£,no_website,4 reviews,"By far the nicest Chinese takeaway in the whole of glengormley staff are lovely food is amazing and so fast with your order and it's so cheap also for the amount u get my favourite Chinese by far ||| I believe this is the finest Chinese Take away in Glengormley. Ordered Chicken balls, chips and curry sauce.... all for £5.30. Very quick to make and serve. Great service. ||| This Chinese is always a corner stone of my lazy Friday night plans. Fountain house is a simple little takeaway that does your run of the mill Chinese takeaway menu. A good mix of Chinese and European dishes that caters for most palates, though I have to say I would struggle to find something spicy enough to suit mine.  ||| It is strange that I would single out Fountain House from the other multitude of Chinese takeaways in Belfast, but I have to say it deserves to be. It does a delivery service that never takes much longer than thirty minutes to arrive at your door, although you have to be within a 3 mile radius of the place to avail of this, and incur the nominal 50p delivery charge. However, if you call ahead to place an order for collection you could be eating within fifteen minutes, and that's pretty convenient. ||| I tend to review a lot of Chinese takeaways - mainly because there are a lot of them in our area, and also because we try so many that I just can't help myself! They have a full, good sized menu, with lots of choice, and my husband is a big fan of thier Satay dishes, and I really like thier Sweet and Sour chicken, as thier battered chicken balls are actually quite tender and nice, which is a fresh change from the usual tough (weird bits) of chicken that usually go into other restaurants chicken balls. The food is good value too, and they deliver promptly and the food is always hot and you can tell it hasn't been sitting in the car too long. The staff are really nice too."
Yum Sing,Carnmoney Road Glengormley Newtownabbey BT36 6HD,028 9083 8882,Takeaway & Fast Food Chinese,no_pricerate,no_website,3 reviews,"Best Chinese in Glengormley. The girl taking the orders is lovely.  ||| Food is consistently great. ||| Would eat from here quite regularly when up at my friends in Glengormely, and it has recently moved premises. We ordered a delivery of salted chilli chicken and chicken curry both with fried rice and an extra portion of salted chilli chips and extra tub of curry - this was more than enough for 3 people and there was some left over as well. Delivery was quick and the order was with us within 20mins, and everything was lovely with the chicken curry having large chunks of onions and mushrooms which I love.  ||| We also got a portion of prawn crackers free with our order and I found these to taste a bit funny, quite like a chemical taste which I found odd and ruined my favourite part of the meal. ||| It wouldn't put me off ordering for them again as it was just a small part of the overall meal. ||| Was a regular customer with yum sing- lnew Chinese on Carmoney road. I ordered weekly, beef or chicken curry for a period of 5 months. Thoroughly enjoyed the curry- nice and spicy..... Until...... Got a lovely long black hair mixed in with the beef curry.  My household has blonde hair so there is no way this came from our home. Never ordered again from them. Very very disappointing as the curry was beautiful.  Will never eat here again.  ||| Rating is low due to the obvious hygiene issue. If this had not of been detected, I would be giving them a four star on food."
Cafe Alfresco,Unit 5 Ferbro Buildings 335 Antrim Rd Glengormley BT36 5DZ,028 9083 8588,Pizza Steakhouses,£,no_website,4 reviews,"Café Alfresco (Glengormley branch) is currently closed for a complete refurbishment and make over. I'll update when the work is completed. But for now, I'm totally gutted. I came here the other day just for some of their coleslaw. Man I coulda cried! Normally Alfresco are known for their out of this world pizzas and relatively inexpensive foods. There are two branches of this café in Newtownabbey; one in the Abbey Centre and one in Glengormley. Both branches are frequented by local employees / staff from nearby shop on their lunch breaks who don't want to eat junk food or fast food, instead preferring the healthier option. Because of this it can mean that it gets very busy around noon / lunch time, but if you come later or earlier than this you'll generally find a great service, lovely staff and some scrummy sandwiches. It's a good option for the health conscious. Their dishes range from their gorgeous garlic sauté potatoes, substantial stews, mouth watering pizzas, plentiful pasta tubs (which come in a really good size) tempting toasties (my favourite!) lovely lasagne, I could go on but I'll leave it to you to go try it out. You can choose the greasy option, but if you like they'll make you up a superior salad bowl with stunning sauces or try one of the beautiful baked potatoes. Yum! ||| Café Alfresco in Glengormley is one of a branch of two, the other being in the massive Abbeycentre shopping complex a mile or so down the road.  ||| The one in the Abbeycentre always seems to flat out busy.  This one, in Glengormley, is not.  To me, I find it a wonder that it still lives, even though it's been fairly likeable any time me or the clan has been in.   ||| There is a current drive to regenerate Glengormley - much needed - and I can only hope that places like here live long enough to see it, because it really is quite good.  There's no extravagance, no overpriced dishes.  It's nice and bright inside, and the service is friendly.  It's not often I would order a steak when I'm out, and I would consider pepper sauce to be predictable and boring - but here, it's hard to fault otherwise. ||| A couple of days ago, I was walking past and decided to peruse the menu (I make a point of this with any restaurant I walk past - I might pop out for a pint of milk, get distracted and be gone for two hours sometimes) - the menu wasn't displayed, just an A-board saying 'Tonight - Serving Only Pizzas and Side Dishes.' ||| Oh God, I thought - could this be the beginning of the end?  Have they laid off everybody but the 17 year old KP? Or, are all the staff out celebrating the fact that they've destroyed their quarterly targets? ||| Hopefully the latter. ||| Cafe Alfresco and its takeaway Pizzarella has a 'deep pan' approach to pizza. Unlike the more traditional thin crust that you might be used to on pizza, they do things a bit differently. They also make sure you get a good helping of cheese on the pizza, which is great at the time of eating it, but maybe a little bit of a regret come bed time. ||| My favourite pizza from here has to be the meat feast. It is just covered with as many different types of meat that you could possibly think could go on a pizza. It actually has full rashers of bacon on it, which I have to admit is something special. ||| They cook their pizza in a traditional pizza oven, which adds another depth to the flavor of the pizza, and they do a fairly efficient delivery service too. Pizza prices range from  £3 to £7.50 and feature two sizes, 9"" and 12"". ||| Café Alfresco does some fantastic pizzas. They are different in terms of the usual Belfast Pizzeria in that the pizza's are deep pan. I'm not usually a fan of deep pan pizzas but this place is the exception. They cook their pizza's to the highest standards and all toppings are top quality. Their vegetarian pizza can be a little on the watery side due to the size of the base, the vegetables can really get soak in and even then its fantastic. They pepperoni pizza is something you can't go wrong with. At around £7 for the 12inch it's great value. You have to wait a little while for the large amount of cheese to stop being thoroughly molten hot, but it's worth that wait!"

China Court,17a Ballyclare Rd Glengormley Newtownabbey BT36 5EU,028 9084 0352,Takeaway & Fast Food Chinese,£,no_website,3 reviews,"Oh wow! First things first, Five star!! And secondly, the story behind this rating ... In a desperate hunt for some yummy noodles to fill my tummy I typed noodles in to the Yelp search section for Glengormley and was slightly horrified to find nearly every review was me harping on about the highs and lows of Chinese restaurants in the area. So, slightly dismayed, I decided to settle for a pizza and that's when I  happened across the greatness that is China Court (which used to be the not so great Jasmine House) So, in true Yelp style I set out to bring you the front line news from the streets of Glengormley. Braving the elements I made a dash for China Court.  God love them because the place was completely empty, guess it can be forgiven seeing as it was 9:30 on Wednesday night, but after a brief glance at the menu and a friendly smile from the waiter, it was settled, I would try China Court out for size. So, flicking past the curries, Cantonese, steaks or European section my eyes lit up at their noodle selection. Not only did they offer a range of chow mein dishes they also offered udon noodles, proper Japanese style! Oh yeah! Seriously, some things are meant to be, and me finding this restaurant was one of them! So, choice decided I sat down at the comfortable waiting area and flicked through the papers. I even read tomorrows papers today, I mean, beat that for convenience! ... Fair enough the Newtownabbey Times offices are round the corner and they must deliver early, but I thought it was pretty cool! Breaking news having broke, my dish was served all boxed and bagged and I set off as a happy bunny in to the night, When I got home I was an even happier bunny as I started tucking in to my food; a special starter and special udon. Wowww! Their noodles ... I literally think I'll dream about them! They were thick, juicy and cooked to perfection. Ah, I could go on and on, but I won't, purely cause I'd say you're not all huge noodle oodle loving monsters like me, but wow, if you are, join in my delight and order some from here. I'm not even exaggerating; they're some of the best I've tasted. MMMmmm yummm, plus the special mix of meats were tantalisingly tasty, my tastebuds were truly tickedled! The starter was a mix of prawn toast, prawn butterfly, ribs, satay and spring rolls. I will with out a doubt be back here. I can't wait! I'll update with hopefully glowing reviews, so until next time. Suzi B out with a satisfied tummy!  ||| ! ||| The nicest Chinese that I have ever tasted in Northern Ireland! Also, if you are looking for some fried ice cream, they can hook you some up!  ||| EDIT 9 JUNE 2014:  ||| I went here last month and got slight food poisoning. I will not be going here ever again and I don't recommend going either. It is illegally open as it doesn't have a food hygiene rating, which is legally required for any businesses that sell food. I have changed the rating from 5 to 1.  ||| Eat at your own risk, I would not suggest getting anything with meat in it, maybe deep fried ice cream, which puts it up a star (from one star) ||| Cold.  Dull.  At least a month of dust in windows. Smeared wipe marks all over tables.  ||| And that's not the worst. I decided against my better judgment and  stayed as I didn't want to cause a fuss.  ||| Older oriental lady wearing a pink coat took the order. After a short wait and a lot of yelling in the kitchen are meal arrived.  The meal looked ok. But when the lady went behind her we bar sink payment area she hacked up a spit and spat in the sink. ||| Omg I was near sick. Never, never ever again.. After a small and easy investigation I discovered they don't haven't passed their hygiene. ||| Do yourself a favour and stay well away"

Personally, I enjoy going in there for a fry of a Sunday morning. It's cheap, tasty and they don't skimp on the mushrooms! What's not to love? ||| I suppose compared to some other cafes, Puccini's is a little run down looking, and it is really small, so if you've got a wheelchair or a buggy, forget it. But given that Glengormley isn't that well served for places like this, it's a winner in my book. ||| This has to be one of the best value cafes anywhere let alone Glengormley. Very reasonable priced menu with top quality food. Excellent service. Give it a try and don't forget to check out the daily chefs specials. ||| I live quite near this little cafe, and had never once been inside to try out what it had to offer, mainly because Glengormley town centre isn't exactly a gorgeous place to hang out, but also because there is a severe lack of parking and accessibility for it - unless you want to sneakily park in the bank across the street and hope no-one sees you! But it's a nice cafe, with good food and pleasant service, which I discovered when I went recently with a pal who is expecting a baby and for that reason isn't going very far from home these days! But we enjoyed a nice snack and pot of tea and had a good catch-up and gossip."

He then came back to #NI and met Jamie and opened 1st store in East #Belfast in 1999 after working for another well known #Pizza chain. They've never looked back. They are both hands on and it's 7 days a week and long hours-they've about 150 staff!! ||| Four Star head office is in #Dublin and is owned by the #Fitzwilliam #hotel group. Running a pizza shop isn't cheap but I can say that each #oven is £25k and this shop has two. The pizzas and all other food takes 5 1/4 minutes to go through at 475oF.  ||| The big #USP is that Four Star have #doughologists. In Newtownabbey The doughologist is called Robyn and she is responsible for preparing fresh dough daily. They use strong wheat flour from Neill's, who are celebrating 150 years this year. Water and oil is mixed with salt, sugar and flour and then yeast and mixed for 15 minutes. The dough then proves for 48 hours before use. For #glutenfree there are rice flour bases. ||| All the other ingredients are freshly delivered by Musgrave so all ingredients are locally sourced and traceable. Scott was saying the menu changes four times a year and this year they are using a local relish Ballymaloe.  ||| I had the opportunity of making tonight's dinner!! I made a #pepperoni pizza (kids), a spicy #chicken on (for my wife) and a super hot #chorizo and #jalapeno pizza for me.....mmmmm ||| Finally Scott made me a ""#flip"" which is a thin base with sauce, #pulledpork, jalapeño and #sriracha and folded over and cooked-it is cheeseless. It tasted great!!!! ||| Big thanks to Scott and Jamie for arranging this. Also if you order online directly or call you will get better deals than if you use Just Eat. Scott and Jamie are also very good at helping local #charities. ||| Forget Dominos, it's all about Four Star Pizza! I ordered my first ever Four Star Pizza last night and I don't think I'll ever look back.  ||| There's loads of benefits to ordering Four Star - First up if you order online and spend over £30 your order is discounted by 20%. They also have far greater choice and a more creative menu than Dominos. We went for the 16 inch 'Feed the Meater' pizza which at £17 was a snip. Jam packed with chicken and pepperoni and easily foldable we definitely made the manly choice. You can order you pizzas as part of a meal deal and get even further discount on side orders. We went for wedges (a little soggy) and curly fries. The sides weren't great to be honest but sides rarely travel well so we'll let them off.  ||| Another bonus is the order arrived with us about 15 minutes after ordering - the shop is only about 5 minutes away but that service is still super speedy. ||| All in all a good takeaway - really greasy so if you're health conscious you may want to swerve it but if you're having a few beverages on a Saturday night it's spot on. Keep an eye on your post box too - they are constantly sending out good deals. ||| Placed an order last night, and the pizzas arrived on time and piping hot. We ordered the Empire and Rodeo pizzas which came as a part of a meal deal for 16"" pizza with 2 sides for £17.99, the fajta wedges were lovely and spicey and the garlic bread was delicious. We did order extra garlic and herb dip as well as BBQ dip which unfortunately we only got the garlic and herb dip not the BBQ but that didn't spoil the dining experience and I would definitely use them again. ||| Much better value for money than Dominoes. Don't get me wrong, I love Dominoes, but it can cost a bloody fortune, and this pizza delivery company does pretty much the same job for a much more reasonable price. Thier pizza is made fresh on the premises with good quality ingredients and the delivery is always prompt - the pizza is never cold. The BBQ Supreme is my favourite, I always say I will try other ones but I never do because the BBQ sauce is so lovely. You can also adapt and change your toppings and side orders etc to match what you really want. And its only a tenner for a 12 inch pizza, that's around a pound a slice - not complaining!"

It is, to us, worth that extra wait time.  ||| I would recommend them but go for collection if you can as it'll save a lot of time. ||| Terrible... used to like it when I ordered chicken then ordered crispy beef and what came out could only be described as battered string. Phoned back and tried to explain that there was no meat and it was just batter to which I got the reply ""well everybody else likes it"" I don't understand how anyone can like burnt battered air?... I'm not exaggerating I could have made better by ripping my pubes out and deep frying them.. Won't be back, up the ToTo... At least they use meat. ||| I was very disappointed at the poor level of service which I received when placing my first telephone order at Spring. The person who answered the phone refused to take my order, and rudely ordered me to call them back in 30 minutes as they were too busy. They could have at least shown me some courtesy and manners and taken my order and advise me that delivery time would be excessive. I have never experienced a fast good delivery company refuse business. Oh well ...... I'll just keep going to ToTo :o)"

Be warned, the portions are HUGE, I've never managed to finish one and quite frankly the portion could easily do two people! ||| Reasonable pricing. Drinks available are fizzy drinks in tins and bottles, plus bottled water. ||| The food is okay in a pinch but two things bother me. 1) Dishes that aren't meant to be spicy, are, and 2) some of the staff can be quite rude, or act like you are inconveniencing them by wanting to order their food - God forbid! ||| I could probably go on about the greatness of this Chinese for about an hour or so. It's that good! Yum yum says my tum! I love it! I used to work in the Abbey Centre and on my lunch break I'd more often than not head here and get their snack box, which is, in my opinion, the best buy. You can try a little of everything from what's on offer, though I find I can never finish it in one go, I always keep half of it for my tea, now that's good value for £5! (I don't know if they do it anymore, but they used to offer 10% off for staff who worked in the centre - try it, it might well work!) I have tried a number of their other dishes which have all been deliciously tasty. If you're around the Abbey centre at lunch time and fancy some top notch Chinese cuisine then head to Yangtze and try it out, trust me, your taste buds will be well and truly tickled! ||| Great food, you'll find it gives your local chinese a run for its money. Service is super-quick too, being a noodle bar in a shopping center that's hardly surprising though. Of particular note is the 'Weekend Specials' they do. You basically get a 'bit of everything' which amounts to a mountain of food, all of which is pretty delicious. Price for such a meal is £4.80 which represents excellent value for money. These are available normally from Thursday-Sunday, but in the run up to Christmas are available everyday. |||  I would equally recommend the rest of the menu. These are people who know chinese food! Small criticisms are, few of them speak English very well, or at all, so if you have a problem or a complaint it can get a little frustrating trying to communicate that to them. Secondly, you will get a plastic knife and fork during busy hours, these are terribly inadequate and break quickly. |||  All-in-all, a worthy 3-stars from me :D"

However, talk about going to the dogs. The food is now microwave ready meal standard at best and i believe some probably is exactly this. Also, the place is empty with no atmosphere probably due to the decline in the food standards and the fact that half the menu isn;t available which they don't make clear till you order.

O'Briens,Longwood Rd Whiteabbey BT37 9UH,no_phone,Sandwiches,no_pricerate,no_website,2 reviews,"This is probably one of the nicest eateries available in the Abbeycentre Food Court - not that there is much competition ||| Their food is fresh however and there are healthy options available, they usually have a toasted Mexican wrap as their special, which is great, and comes served with a side salad and some crisps. ||| You can have sandwiches made to order as well, and there are loads of fresh fillings available! ||| Avoid this place, £6.95 for a baked potato. I ordered with the women behind the counter, she said ""go tell him what you ordered""  him was was on the till. I told him what I ordered a baked potato with ham and cheese. I gave him £20 he gave charge I checked the receipt £6.95. I said are you serious £6.95 for a spud 1 spud(potato) he turned his back to me and walked away AVOID THIS PLACE. Who do they think they are charging these extortionate prices, Save your money and buy a 10kg bag of spuds for £5 you will have money left in your pocket. Day light robbery."
Barista Coffee House,Loughshore Park Shore Road Jordanstown BT37 0PL,028 9065 5332,Coffee & Tea Shops Breakfast & Brunch,no_pricerate,no_website,2 reviews,"This place is a bit of a goldmine. Loughshore is a very popular spot for the public due to the caravan park, children's play park, beach etc, so Barista are in the perfect position to cater to the crowds. ||| They do the usual teas, coffee, hot chocolate and soft drinks, plus traybakes, sandwiches, some hot food options and ice cream. ||| We only stopped in for a cold drink after our visit to the park, but I liked the look of the cafe and as stated before, it's a great addition to the area due to the amount of people it draws! ||| Good strong coffee, didn't know weather to drink it or smoke it. Not watery or over milked. Perfect place for cafe barista, I still miss the chippy van that used to be in the car park years ago but it is better having somewhere you can sit in and shelter if its a rough day."

Situated in The Diamond area of Rathcoole, it's local to the Abbeycentre shopping area, convenient for a post shopping tea time treat!  ||| Locals swear by this place, I have a friend that can't go a week without buying a burger & chip from here. The food is just brilliant. They offer a wide range of choices - chips, burgers, fish, chicken, sausages, also a range of meal deals and drinks. All for quite competitive prices and the portions are HUGE! (A tip, given their portions,  I've found your eyes can often be a lot bigger than your belly!)"
The Crescent,1 Kings Cresent Shopping Centre Doagh Rd Newtownabbey BT37 0DH,028 9036 5560,Fish & Chips Takeaway & Fast Food,£,no_website,2 reviews,"There a 3 things that make The Crescent the best chip shop I know. ||| (1) Chicken fillet burgers ||| (2) Curry cheesy chips ||| (3)  Battered Mars Bars ||| To explain in more detail, for say roughly the past 5 years I've often visited both this branch (Kings Crescent) and their other in Monkstown. Used to be on a Friday night my friends and I would get the vodka in, go to the video store and rent a movie, then head to The Cresent for a good old dirty chippy. Ah those were the days! ||| Their chicken burgers are nearly the size of my head, no joke! They're scrummy! You really can't get a better burger anywhere else. The chicken is unbelievable juicy, completely tender and battered to perfection. They also make the nicest curry cheesy chips (I'm sure some of you reading this will be thinking, curry? and cheese? What? But really, don't knock it until you've tried it. Then you can thank me, you're welcome in advance by the way!)  ||| And so we move on to the battered Mars Bars. Now, I know this is a controversial subject, a bit like Marmite, you either love it or hate it, but personally, I'm a lover (of Mars Bars, definitely not Marmite) and I dread to think that some of you poor souls won't even have heard of the greatness that is the battered Mars Bar. If this is the case, go to the Crescent right now and get one. It's one of those, you must try these before you die. You will not regret it! ||| Grim witha capital G....Overcooked, nasty and overpriced.....If you want quantity forget it.....another reason not to eat out of a chippy. Processed, lazy, dipped in hot fat and finished in salt and vinegar....low buy in cost, low prep cost, no work to cook and charged at 3/4 the price of sitting in a restaurant and eating better......"

KFC,Longwood Rd Whiteabbey BT37 9UH,no_phone,Takeaway & Fast Food Chicken Shop Chicken Wings,no_pricerate,kfc.com,1 review,"Got a burrito meal in here , opted for the original recipe, still had a bit of spice to it. The burrito was well wrapped and warm. The meal came to under £7 for a burrito, fries and a coffee. I thought the burrito might not have been that nice but I decided to try it and it was actually tasty there was chicken, cheese, lettuce, beans and flavoured and spiced rice. Was really filling and I would buy again only thing for me was that the chicken didnt have the usual kfc flavour tasted slightly different but it was still nice. The coffee was really hot was nice flavour . Lots of seating to sit at, staff were friendly and I was served in reasonable time."

You'll be really pleased ... and take a look at the price tag, top quality food for incredible prices, you just can't beat it!"

Ordered my double sausage mcmuffin and literally it was thrown onto my tray!!!! Not impressed!!!! Tasted ok, was only like warm, but what to do!?!?"
